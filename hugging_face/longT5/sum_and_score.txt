summary: the narrator explains how to govern principalities. He discusses three kinds of states: 1) republics; 2) principalities; and 3) "new principalities." The first is a state where people are familiar with their rulers and are therefore familiar with what they will do in the future. The second reason for holding a new state is that people will be willing to trade one recent ruler for another. This will lead to foreigners taking up arms against an unestablished prince who has recently conquered his country. If the people live in the same language as the former prince's country, it will make it easier for the prince to keep control over the newly acquired state. People will stay peacefully in the old state so long as they have not changed their ways of life. It is more difficult to hold on to a New Principality if there are different languages or customs than the prince owns. One way to deal with these differences is to settle down in the new State. By living in the New State, the Prince can address problems faster and efficiently. His subjects will be less likely to think twice before trying to takeover the state. Finally, he can use colonialism to weaken neighboring states by making them weaker. A prince must always act to resolve problems before they become fully manifested. There are two types of governments: 1) princes and ministers, and 2) nobles and nobles, both of whom benefit from their ancestral lineage. These two groups are better suited to governing a central government because they have no incentive to corrupt foreign powers or turn on their own subjects. They are also easier to hold onto a monarchy governed by nobles since they have subjected themselves to the ruling family. However, if the kingdom is ruled by men, it is even harder to maintain its control. Thus, the only way to get rid of a sovereign is to kill off the entire family.
	the narrator explains how princes can acquire states through their own abilities rather than luck or noble birth. Princes that rely on their own powers will be more successful in acquiring states because they are able to meet the challenges of establishing new orders. Private citizens who have good fortune become princes by good fortune and receive favor from others in power. These people are weak because they lack a solid basis for their rule. A prince needs to eliminate rival leaders so that his subjects do not oppose him. He uses examples such as Cesare Bjoria, who was made Duke of Romagna by Pope Alexander VI after his father's death. This example illustrates how a person can rise to power when he commits criminal acts. If he is willing to commit crime, he should use cruelty in order to protect his subjects. When he seizes a state with no harm to his subjects, then he must decide how much injury he will suffer. The second way he can gain power is through his fellow citizens, who are heads of Constitutional Principalities. Each city is inhabited by two groups: the common people and the nobles
	the narrator explains how princes must find ways to ensure that their citizens are dependent on their authority. He uses examples from Italy's history to demonstrate how important it is for a country to have a strong army. Princes need to be well educated in order to keep their kingdom strong during times of crisis. The art of war is the most important discipline a prince has to learn.
	the narrator explains how princes are able to achieve great things through their generosity. Some argue that it is better to be loved than to be fearful, but this is not always the case. Princes need to be careful not to show compassion too harshly. A prince needs to make sure that his subjects do not take advantage of him in any way. He should not confiscate his property or take women because these actions are likely to lead to hatred. With an army, there are no such things as too many cruelty. In How Princes Should keep Their Word
	the narrator discusses two ways for princes to gain fame: by declaring an ally in a conflict and by encouraging his citizens to prosper. A good example of this strategy is Ferdinand of Spain's military campaign against Granada-Aflancia-Ita-and-France. Princes can win prestige by proclaiming that he will support one side or another. If the victor loses, the prince defends himself through an alliance; if the opposing side wins, he protects himself with an alliance. A prince shouldn't think that a totally safe course exists because he has no choice but to accept the less risky course. He should reward his citizens for their prosperity and encourage them to excel in business and occupations. When it comes to selecting ministers, there are three kinds of intellect: 1) ability to understand something independently; 2) ability to appreciate someone else's abilities to understand things; and 3) ability to do nothing. The first type is best, "the second acceptable," while the second useless. A wise prince should always seek advice when he needs it. A bad minister should be punished severely if they ever find out that the truth is hidden from him. A smart prince should have a confidence relationship with his advisors. A new prince who follows the advice of the prince will enjoy stability since men are aware of the future.
