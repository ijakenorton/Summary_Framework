his house, waiting for him to emerge.", "They greet each other, and note that it's strange that one of the servants has been sent to collect money from Timon, while his master wears enormous jewels recently given him by Timon.", "The servants find it odd that Timon's friends should demand their loans paid back when they still enjoy Timon's gifts.", "The servants know their lords have sucked up

passion, and asks that he be freed.", "One senator replies that Alcibiades speaks as if he's trying to make manslaughter legal.", "Revenge is not a valorous action; rather, learning to bear slights and suffering is preferable, says the senator.", "Alcibiades then speaks as a soldier, to whom slights mean action.", "If bearing suffering is valorous, does that mean prisoners are wiser than those who judge them?", "Alcibiades begs that they consider his friend acted rashly, but doesn't everyone sometimes do the same?", "The senators say Alcibiades's efforts are in vain.", "Alcibiades insists that his friend's actions for Athens on the battlefield should be sufficient payment for his freedom.", "The senators condemn Alcibiades's friend to death, but Alcibiades offers his own achievements as further barter for his friend.", "The law, he declares, is just as strict as war, and they both have succeeded at war.", "Alcibiades begs them to reconsider his requests.", "But the senators are

enormous, he predicts.", "Back at Timon's house, Flavius and several servants discuss what has happened.", "They're amazed that such a great house has fallen, and that none of them have yet gone into the wilderness with Timon to serve him.", "The servants must depart, and are sad.", "Flavius shares his last cash out among them, and they all swear to greet each other kindly should they meet again in future.", "They all depart, and Flavius considers how anyone would wish to be free from wealth, if riches inevitably lead to misery and to false friendship.", "He mourns his lord's fall, brought down through his own kindness.", "When Timon has fallen so far for the sin of being good, it makes one not want to try so hard to be kind in the future!", "Flavius notes that his lord's former riches have now brought about his greatest suffering.", "He determines to continue to serve him, and follows after him into the woods.", "Timon comes out of his cave and considers the sun and the earth.",

of mankind, and he hopes it comes to destruction.", "He digs for roots in the ground, and suddenly finds gold!", "Astonished to have found gold when he now needs it least, Timon speaks of the awful power of wealth, how gold, \"this yellow slave\" , makes or breaks religion, makes thieves into senators, and convinces aged widows to wed again.", "He orders the earth to behave normally, to hide the

and Alcibiades promises to help him when he has sacked Athens.", "Timon perks up at the mention of an assault on Athens.", "He gives Alcibiades gold to support his campaign, urging him to kill everyone, even old men, virgins, children, women or priests.", "Alcibiades takes the gold, but hesitates at taking his advice.", "The prostitutes ask for gold too, and he gives it to them, urging them to continue in their profession, spreading illness among all their patrons.", "He urges them to give diseases to the men of Athens, to bring all men to squalid deaths.", "Alcibiades and the prostitutes prepare to depart for Athens, and Timon says he hopes he never sees Alcibiades again.", "Alcibiades is surprised, saying he never harmed Timon.", "Yet Timon shoos him away.", "Timon continues digging in the ground for edible roots, speaking with disgust of mankind.", "Then Apemantus enters.", "Timon curses him, but Apemantus absorbs his slights, noting that his recent change in fortune has made Timon unlike himself, while his former flatterers still live in silk-lined comfort, forgetting Timon ever existed.", "Apemantus says it's only fair that Timon has sunk to this, for

Timon.", "Apemantus says Timon has become a beggar by his own compulsion, and would gladly be a rich man again if he could.", "Timon has willed himself into misery, says Apemantus.", "Timon insists Apemantus's experiences have been different, since he was never in fortune's favor.", "If Apemantus had lived Timon's life, he would have wasted himself away without reaching respectability.", "But Timon was like an oak whose leaves blew off in one blast of wintry air, and now must nakedly bear misfortune.", "It's harder for him, he says, since he never experienced it before, but Apemantus is used to suffering.", "Why does Apemantus hate mankind, Timon asks, when men have never flattered him?", "If Apemantus curses anyone, it should be his father, who left him to be raised by a beggar woman.", "Timon urges him to leave, saying if he had not been born the most miserable of men, he would have been a hateful flatterer.", "Apemantus asks him if he is done ranting, and offers him food.", "Timon tells Apemantus to go back to Athens.", "Timon continues cursing Apemantus, who observes that Timon has to be an extremist: \"the middle of humanity thou never knewest, but the extremity of both ends\" .", "Timon asks Apemantus if anyone ever loved him; Apemantus replies that only he himself has.", "Timon asks what Apemantus would do with the world, if he had the power.",

fertility from excrement.", "Everything is a thief, therefore, and everyone also.", "Timon sends the bandits to Athens, tells them to break into shops and steal as much as he has given them.", "The thieves are impressed by his speech, so much so that Timon nearly convinces them to leave their profession than to go on stealing.", "They realize Timon advises them thus out of hatred for mankind, not out of enthusiasm for thievery.", "But they decide to head to Athens before giving up their trade, and exit.", "Flavius arrives, speaking sadly about his fallen master.", "How vile is friendship, he says, that it has made Timon fall so far.", "When Timon sees him, he asks if he recognizes him.", "Timon says he has forgotten all men, so Flavius says he was once Timon's poor honest servant.",

garden.", "She desperately wishes to find the garden because it has been locked for so long--if she could only go inside, she thinks, she could invent her own games and play them there alone, and no one would ever know where she was, nor how and where to find her.", "It is this thought that so compels her.", "That Mary is compelled at all, by anything, signals quite a change in her character, since she had always been entirely passive during her life in India.", "At Misselthwaite, in the fresh air of the moor, she is beginning to be involved in the world around her, and her imagination is reviving.", "Though Mary closely examines the thick ivy that grows upon the stone walls of the garden, she cannot find the door, and, at length, returns to the manor.", "There, Martha announces that

some of the ivy growing upon the stone wall.", "Beneath the ivy is a door, which Mary unlocks with the key she unearthed the day before.", "She finds herself standing inside the secret garden.", "Inside the secret garden, Mary finds a great many rosebushes, and standard roses that have been allowed to grow as large as trees; the flowerless vines of climbing roses have overgrown all else, and make lovely curtains in the air.", "It is a strange and silent place, for no one has entered it for ten years; Mary thinks it must be very different from gardens that have not been so abandoned.",

to write a letter to Dickon: he would certainly agree to buy tools and flower seeds on one of his trips to Thwaite, the village nearby.", "Mary writes the letter, and is very excited by the idea that Dickon will bring the supplies to her himself--she had never expected to see the boy whom even the animals adore.", "Martha also mentions that her mother has agreed to have Mary visit the cottage, and

did during the storm.", "Martha again refuses to admit that she too hears the sound, and flees the room to avoid answering Mary's questions.", "In the week after her first entry beyond its walls, Mary

garden, in an effort to cultivate the few plants she knows to be alive.", "Mary is becoming healthier, and less contrary, and more engaged in the world with each day that she passes at Misselthwaite.", "During this time, her acquaintance with Ben Weatherstaff develops into friendship, and Mary attempts to covertly ask him for advice on gardening.", "Ben Weatherstaff tells her that he once tended the garden of a woman who \"loved like they was children or robins,\" and, though she died, he still cares for her roses once or twice a year.", "Mary asks him if roses die when they are left to themselves, and how one might determine if they are dead or alive.", "Ben replies that one must wait till spring to know for certain.", "She continues questioning him about his work with the abandoned roses until he becomes unaccountably angry with her and walks off once again.", "After this encounter, Mary follows one of the laurel-paths into the woods in search of rabbits.", "She hears an odd whistling sound and, following it, comes upon a boy playing a wooden pipe beneath one of the trees.", "The boy is surrounded by animals-a pheasant, a squirrel, two rabbits-and Mary knows him almost immediately as Dickon Sowerby, the famous animal-charmer.", "She is thrilled to see him, but, as she is not used to boys, initially feels rather shy in his company.", "Dickon tells Mary that he received Martha's letter, and gives her the gardening tools and seeds that she had asked him to buy.", "Mary is very taken with the ease of Dickon's Yorkshire speech, as well as with his ruddy looks and patchwork clothing; to her, there is \"a clean fresh scent of heather and grass and leaves about him, as if he were made of them.", "Thinking of this, Mary is suddenly and completely at ease with him, and forgets her shyness.", "After a few moments, the robin redbreast joins the pair beneath the tree.", "The boy appears to speak to the bird in robin-language, asking if he is a friend of Mary's.", "Dickon explains to Mary how to tend the seeds he has brought her, and then asks to see the place where she intends to plant them, as he wishes to help.", "Mary is extremely anxious about sharing the secret of the garden with him.", "Dickon tells her that she needn't mistrust him, for he keeps such secrets all the time, to protect his wild things from the violence of other boys.",

Mary that he had heard of the secret garden from Martha, but never imagined that he would step inside it.", "He begins to investigate which of the plants are alive, and remarks that the secret garden would make a marvelous nesting place for birds, as there are no people there to harm them.", "The two busily set to work, clearing away the dead wood and more of the weeds.", "Dickon is impressed at how much Mary, who knew nothing of gardening, has been able to accomplish on her own.", "Mary replies, simply, that she likes the smell of the earth.", "Mary asks Dickon if he will help her with the garden, and Dickon happily agrees.", "Noting how many of the plants are still alive, Dickon wonders aloud if perhaps someone else hasn't been in the garden in the ten years since Master Craven locked its door.", "Mary tells Dickon that she wishes to grow flowers that look like bells, in defiance of the nursery taunt that the clergyman's children shouted at her, \"Mistress Mary, quite contrary, How

leaving Misselthwaite again the following day.", "Mary is delighted at his imminent departure, but dreads meeting him: she is certain they will despise each other.", "Mrs. Medlock leads Mary to Master Craven's sitting room, where they find him sitting before a fire.", "Mary then sees that he is not precisely a hunchback, though his shoulders are crooked-in fact, he would be handsome if not for the terrible misery in his face.", "He admits that he simply forgot to attend to Mary, and asks her if she would like a governess or nurse to keep her company.", "Mary fervently declares that she would much rather play on the moor, and grow strong before she begins her education.", "He agrees, and asks if there is anything at all she wants.", "Mary replies that she wants nothing more than \"a bit of earth\" for her gardening.", "Mr. Craven is quite moved by this request, as it reminds him of his late wife's love of gardens, and tells her that she may have any piece of land she wants, from anywhere on the manor grounds.", "Mary rushes back to the nursery and tells Martha that her uncle has given her permission to keep a bit of earth and to visit with Martha's family.", "She then hurries

confined to the manor house all the following day.", "Once so awakened, she is too upset to go back to sleep.", "The wind and rain sound to Mary like human wails-\"like a person lost on the moor and wandering on and on crying.\"", "After lying awake for nearly an hour, Mary hears something beneath the sound of the storm: the same cries she heard in the corridor, as of a child weeping.", "In

door to a room in which a light is still burning.", "Upon entering the room, Mary finds a thin, curious-looking boy lying upon a massive four-poster bed.", "The boy is as white as a statue, as though he has been ill, and he is crying.", "Each child is not certain whether the other is a ghost, or a dream, and, for a long while, they simply stare speechlessly at one other.", "The boy is Colin Craven, Master Craven's son.", "He was born ten years before, in the same year in which Mary was born and the secret garden locked shut.", "Colin's father cannot bear to see him, as Colin reminds him

this one.", "At Colin's instruction, Mary draws back a rose-colored curtain hanging over the mantelpiece to reveal a picture of a laughing woman with gray eyes exactly like Colin's own.", "Colin tells Mary that this is a portrait of his mother.", "It is kept covered for two contradictory reasons: on the one hand, Colin dislikes that she is laughing while he is so ill and unhappy; on the other, he

family, the subject of conversation again returns to Ellen Olenska.", "May's mother blames the Countess's unconventionality on her eccentric European upbringing, and she thanks Archer for convincing Ellen not to sue for divorce.", "Archer is secretly annoyed, feeling that by not allowing her to divorce, the Mingott clan is ensuring that Ellen will eventually become the mistress of Beaufort rather than the lawful wife of some upstanding man.", "Alone with May, Archer again presses her to shorten the length of their engagement.", "May surprises him by asking why he wants a short engagement.",

afraid that this is because he is still in love with his mistress of years past.", "May feels that if Archer is still in love, his passions for his mistress should come before his social obligations to May.", "Newland, caught off guard, fumbles in his speech, but manages to reassure May that is she that he loves.", "As soon as May is reassured, she returns to her usual complacency, and Archer is

fears that there is another woman.", "Archer confesses that May is correct and that it is Ellen he would marry if it were possible for either of them.", "Ellen responds that it is Archer that has made a marriage between them impossible, for she had nothing to fear from Count Olenski's letter, and she decided not to sue for divorce only because Archer himself told her she should.", "Archer is astonished.", "For a moment, he tries to convince Ellen that there is still time and that he can break from his engagement and she can divorce.", "She refuses, responding that it was Archer himself

Europe for their honeymoon.", "May is concerned that she will be required to visit Archer's foreign acquaintances.", "Her anxiety, we learn, is typical of the Old New York crowd, whose fear of Europeans causes them to travel abroad in a state of isolation.", "Archer, meanwhile, abandons his attempts to educate May; for \"there was no use in trying to educate a wife who had not the dimmest notion that she was not free.\"", "He reconciles himself to the fact that his married life will still allow him an active intellectual life outside of the home.", "As for his own feelings towards European culture, he decides that it is too different from his own way of life to capture his imagination for very long.", "Archer does convince May to attend a dinner party hosted by some family friends in London.", "At the dinner, he meets a young Frenchman who serves as the family's tutor.", "Archer is intrigued by the man's vivid conversation and his conviction that being intellectually free is worth living in poverty.", "After dinner, he mentions to May that he would like to invite the Frenchman to dinner.", "May dismisses this idea with laughter, and Archer sees that this is how disagreements between them will be solved in the future.", "After their three-month honeymoon, the Archers rejoin Old New York society in Newport for the annual archery competition.", "By now, married life has become predictable but placid for Archer.", "Ellen has been relegated to the back of his memory, remaining there only as a \"plaintive ghost\" of his past.", "At the archery competition, May

day with him.", "She asks him why he didn't fetch her at the shore that day in Newport.", "When he answers that it was because she didn't turn around, she responds that she didn't turn around on purpose.", "She confesses that she had gone to the beach to get as far away from Archer as she could.", "Later that afternoon, at lunch in a private dining room, Ellen explains herself further.", "She

desperate with the thought that he might not be able to see her again.", "Ellen promises that she will not return to her husband or to Europe as long as she and Newland do not act upon their love for one another.", "Despite his failure to extract any more than a tenuous promise from Ellen, Archer is nonetheless comforted by their agreement and returns the next day to New York.", "As he arrives at the train station, he is surprised to meet the French tutor he had met abroad in London, and he invites the young man to call on him that afternoon.", "In Archer's office, the tutor relates that he had seen Archer the day before in Boston.", "He informs Archer that he was there to speak with Ellen on behalf of Count Olenski.", "Despite his connection with the Count, however, the tutor firmly believes that Ellen should not return to him and asks Archer to persuade the Mingott family to change their mind regarding the issue.", "At this moment, Archer realizes that he has been excluded from the family's negotiations over Ellen's fate because they saw that he was not on their side.", "He asks the tutor why he feels Ellen should not accept the offer.", "The tutor explains that Ellen has changed, that she has become more American, and that going back to her old European life would be unbearable for her now that she has adapted to New York customs.", "We learn from the tutor's speech that he has known the Count and Ellen for many years.", "This leads Archer to wonder if he is perhaps the secretary rumored to have had an affair with Ellen.", "Autumn soon arrives, and with it Archer's mother's usual complaints that society has changed in recent years for the worse.", "Evidence of this societal decay is the extravagant new fall fashions, Beaufort's rumored recent financial problems following unlawful speculations, and the success of Mrs. Lemuel Struthers's vulgar Sunday evening parties.", "At Thanksgiving dinner, the conversation turns to Ellen Olenska, who was one of the first to attend the Struthers parties.", "Ellen has again disappointed the family by refusing to return to her husband.", "Remaining in Washington with Medora, she is now considered to be a hopeless case.", "Archer himself has not heard from her for several months.", "When Sillerton Jackson makes the waggish suggestion that Ellen may lose some financial assistance should Beaufort lose his fortune, Archer angrily responds to this implication of adultery.", "After his outburst, he realizes that he has exposed his ignorance of the family's decisions regarding Ellen.", "Unbeknownst to him, they have greatly reduced her allowance upon her refusal to return to her husband, leaving her next to penniless.", "Upon returning home, Archer invents an excuse to tell May to justify his going to Washington the next day.", "While May wishes him a good journey, her eyes indicate that she is quite aware that Archer means to see Ellen there.", "Archer's plans to leave for Washington are thwarted by the collapse of Beaufort's business dealings, which promise to be the worst disaster Wall Street has ever seen.", "News soon reaches Archer that Mrs. Mingott has had a stroke.", "When he reaches her home, he is informed of the cause of her stroke.", "Mrs. Beaufort had been to see Mrs. Mingott the night before and had asked her the impossible: that the family support Beaufort through his financial collapse.", "Mrs. Mingott had refused, but the shock of Mrs. Beaufort's effrontery was great enough to induce a stroke.", "Mrs. Mingott requests to see Ellen.", "May exclaims that it is a pity that her train to New York will cross Archer's train bound for Washington on the way.", "Archer is directed to send a telegram to Ellen to request her to come to New York.", "A day later, she

Krook's shop.", "It's a shop in name only, really, since Krook mostly seems to be a crazed hoarder who only buys things; he doesn't actually sell them.", "Krook is a skeletal old man who keeps a vicious-looking cat named Lady Jane.", "The \"shop\" is jam-packed with pretty much every kind of detritus imaginable: bottles, clothes, law books, rags, maritime supplies, human hair, bones, parchment scrolls, old documents, and so on.", "Krook also has advertisements on the window, one of which is a kind of job-wanted ad from a copyist named Nemo.", "OK, brace yourselves for some symbolism.", "Krook is known around the neighborhood as the Lord Chancellor, and his shop is nicknamed the Court of Chancery!", "That's pretty deep, guys.", "All that human detritus, gathered up, rotting, and useless, is the same in this weird shop as in the real court.", "Anyhow, Krook kind of freaks out when he hears that the gang, or at least Ada and Richard, are involved in Jarndyce.", "He recites some facts about the case, shocking them all with his detailed knowledge.", "Then Krook tells the sad tale of Tom Jarndyce, who dealt with the case for a long time and eventually grew so depressed by the whole thing that he blew his brains out, saying that waiting for the settlement is like \"being ground to bits in a slow mill; it's being roasted at a slow fire; it's being stung to death by single bees; it's being drowned by drops; it's going mad by grains\" .", "Wow.", "Everyone is shaken up by this story, then the little old lady takes them up to her apartment on the third floor.", "There's almost nothing there, and Esther realizes that the lady is so thin because she's poor and doesn't have enough to eat.", "The woman shows them her many birds but won't tell them their names yet.", "She keeps the birds under cover so they don't sing when she's in court.", "She eventually wants to free the birds when the judgment is given but assumes they'll die in their cages.",

law-writer lives there.", "Esther is walking last, and Krook corners her and demonstrates that although he is totally illiterate he has a good memory: he can write the words \"Jarndyce\" and Bleak House one letter at a time.", "It's a little bizarre.", "As they leave, Ada gets sad about being involved in the court case and thus being made enemies with random relatives whom she doesn't even know.", "Richard agrees that the whole thing is a colossal waste of time, money, and sanity.", "They drop Caddy off at home, get into a carriage, and roll out of the city.", "OK, so the troupe gets the heck out of Dodge, and with every mile out of the city the weather looks nicer and the outdoors greener and more pleasant.", "Richard and Ada discuss the fact that Mr. Jarndyce's least-favorite thing in the world is to be thanked for the many good things he does.", "Like, one time he saw Ada's mom coming to say thanks and ran away from his house for three months.", "Um, OK.", "They prepare themselves to not thank him for anything.", "When they get to Bleak House, Mr. Jarndyce meets them, calls them by their first names, which was a huge deal back then, and really only reserved for family - meaning he's super warm and friendly and wants to be close.", "Ada kind of very slightly hints at possibly being grateful to him, and he almost bolts but doesn't.", "Mr. Jarndyce asks the gang about Mrs. Jellyby.", "They all kind of hem and haw about how dedicated she is to the Africans and then finally confess that she's an off-putting mess.", "He seems concerned and talks about how the wind is suddenly in the east.", "OK, a little Shmooptastic aside.", "This whole wind-in-the-east business is Jarndyce's way of indicating that he's upset about something.", "Once he calms down, he says the wind is no longer in the east.", "It's based on a proverbial idea that an east wind blows disease and bad odors or something.", "Fun brain snack: the east wind is also an evil force in the Old Testament and The Lord of the Rings trilogy.", "Then again, it's the east wind that blows Mary Poppins to the Banks children, so it's not always a bad thing.", "OK, then, where were we?", "Oh, yes.", "Ada calms Jarndyce down about the Jellybys by telling him that Esther was super awesome in dealing with the kids there.", "Esther is all shy and denies doing much.", "She says Ada is just being nice, but Ada insists.", "Mutual admiration society.", "Jarndyce takes them on a tour of the house, which is old and irregular, with additions built onto the original structure in no particular sense or order.", "Esther loves it.", "Jarndyce announces dinner in a half an hour and tells them about his friend Harold Skimpole who will join them.", "First, though, Esther gets the keys to the castle, literally.", "Every wonder what that expression means?", "Well, in a large household, the person running the place was the housekeeper, who managed the servants, the kitchen, the cleaning of the house, etc.", "And to do all that, the housekeeper would have keys to all the doors, closets, storage rooms, the wine cellar, the linen cupboards, the pantry, the silverware drawers, and whatever else.", "Basically, it's a big deal.", "Esther can't believe the crazy honor and huge responsibility of the keys.", "It's far, far more important than just being a governess.", "Dinnertime.", "Our friends meet Harold Skimpole, who is an easy-going, totally relaxed dude who happily tells them that he is a naive imbecile when it comes to money, property, time, duty, responsibility, or any of the other things grownups have to deal with.", "He's tried being a doctor and a painter but isn't really into working or supporting his wife and children, so he just sponges off Jarndyce.", "He actually tells them all of this.", "Of course, our first reaction is ewww, what a horrible person.", "But Esther is charmed by the fact that he's telling them these seemingly personal things up front and that he's so friendly.", "Exactly how good-looking would he have to be to make all of this sound delightful rather than disgusting?", "Moving along.", "After dinner, Esther is suddenly called to take care of Skimpole, who has been \"took.\"", "She thinks that means he's had some kind of fit, but when she gets to his room, she finds him about to be arrested for debts.", "Richard is already there.", "Skimpole is not embarrassed in the least by the situation, which totally floors Esther, who feels doubly embarrassed on his behalf.", "Actually he's so unembarrassed that he hits Richard and Esther up for money to avoid going to debtors' prison.", "He is completely unselfconscious about the whole matter.", "They spend what little they have paying the man who has come to arrest him.", "Skimpole nicknames this man Coavinses, after the name of the prison where he was about to go.", "He then asks Coavinses whether he felt bad about coming to arrest him.", "Coavinses says no.", "Later that night Jarndyce finds out this nonsense and is upset that Richard and Esther paid the money instead of just going to find him.", "He tells them that Skimpole has this sort of problem almost every week and that they shouldn't bail him out any more, but should just tell him and he'll do it.", "Because that's just the kind of enabling friend he is.", "He's kind of mad at Skimpole for asking Richard and Esther for money in the first place but then decides that this just shows how naive and innocent the guy is.", "For the record, Skimpole is not innocent or naive.", "It's pretty clear from his conversation that he knows everything about everything and this whole naive shtick is an act.", "Finally everyone goes to bed, and Esther wonders how Skimpole has managed to avoid having any responsibilities whatsoever.", "It's raining cats and dogs in the world's least pleasant place to be, Chesney Wold, the Dedlocks' estate.", "Luckily they aren't there , but their housekeeper, Mrs. Rouncewell, is.", "She's been a servant with the Dedlocks for 50 years now and is obviously pretty committed to the whole lord-of-the-manor thing.", "She has two sons.", "One ran off and joined the army and was never heard from again.", "The other was a born engineer who left for \"the North.\"", "The north of England is where the Industrial Revolution is happening as the novel takes place.", "Not sure what that is?", "Quick brain snack.", "In the middle of the 19th century, technologies for producing goods started to advance by leaps and bounds.", "Instead of small groups of highly skilled people making stuff in little workshops, factories were created, where many low-skilled workers could manufacture the same stuff by using division of labor .", "Cheap workers, sped-up production, and cheap raw materials from England's many colonies ended up lowering prices and in short order made England into the world's economic powerhouse.", "So Mrs. Rouncewell's son is all about that.", "She's kind of bummed though that he didn't go into the family business of being servants, which probably sounded less nuts back in the day than it does to our freedom-loving modern American ears.", "Mrs. Rouncewell's grandson Watt is visiting.", "He's psyched to see grandma and everything, but he's even more psyched to check out the hot new maid, Rosa.", "OK, maybe hot is the wrong word, since she's shy, modest, and all those awesome repressive things.", "Rosa is learning how to be a maid and so far she has learned how to show the house to visitors.", "Meaning what?", "Check it out - you know how nowadays when you go visiting castles and old estates in Europe they are all set up as museums and there are tour guides and gift shops and all that good stuff?", "Well, back in Victorian times, people still actually lived in those places, but because they were beautiful and had all kinds of fancy art and objects in them, you could stop by and take a tour without having to know the people who lived there.", "A special servant would take you around and tell you about what you were looking at.", "So servants would have to memorize the spiel - which is what Rosa has been doing.", "There is a knock at the door.", "Turns out it's Mr. Guppy and another guy.", "They are clerks who know Mr. Tulkinghorn, and since they happened to have a few hours free from a case nearby, they wanted to check out the sightseeing.", "Rosa takes them around the house and Watt joins the tour group.", "Guppy is totally bored the whole time until he sees a portrait of Lady Dedlock and... freaks out.", "He swears he's seen the painting or the woman herself before.", "But that's crazy talk, because how could he ever have seen Lady Dedlock?", "And no one had ever made a print of the portrait.", "Guppy can't get over it, though.", "Meanwhile Mrs. Rouncewell tells the gang the story of The Ghost's Walk, one of the mansion's terraces.", "Speaking of which, you know what's not a good name for a pretty terrace?", "\"The Ghost's Walk.\"", "Also not awesome?", "The Ghoul's Crawl, The Demon's Run, or The Vampire's Creep.", "Seriously, people.", "Turns out, a few centuries ago, the then Lady Dedlock cursed the Dedlock family.", "She also said that her steps would forever be heard on the terrace whenever some horrible thing was about to happen to a Dedlock.", "Nice.", "So it's only been one night, but Esther is totally settling into her new digs.", "She's psyched to be in charge of the housekeeping keys and making tea.", "At breakfast Harold Skimpole talks about how bees tick him off because they're so busy and productive, or some such nonsense.", "We'll have to take Esther's word for it that he is really fun to be around; he sounds to us like the most annoying human being on earth.", "Afterwards Jarndyce shows Esther his study, called \"The Growlery\" because he goes there to growl.", "There's kind of an odd moment where Esther kisses his hand, overcome by all sorts of feelings, and this makes Jarndyce have feelings too.", "Feelings, feelings, feelings.", "To break the half-paternal, half-romantic mood, Jarndyce tells her that the other Jarndyce who killed himself because of the Chancery lawsuit used to live in Bleak House.", "He was so obsessed with the lawsuit that he totally stopped taking care of the house.", "That speaks to the theme of people abandoning their domestic responsibilities.", "Wow, sucks, Esther tells him, but then compliments him on how nice he's made the house since inheriting it.", "Jarndyce is flattered.", "Then he nicknames Esther - 20-year old, naive, pretty young Esther - \"little old woman.\"", "Oh how very nice.", "Esther tells us that this nickname stuck so well that \"my own name soon became quite lost\" .", "Still, Jarndyce clearly really values her opinions.", "They talk about what Richard should do with his life.", "Oh, yeah, Richard - remember him?", "He's just fresh from school and needs to find a job.", "Esther suggests asking him what he's into.", "Jarndyce tells her to call him Guardian.", "Life goes on for a little while, and Esther and Ada discover that since Jarndyce is such a rich and generous guy, he's constantly being hit up for money by all sorts of crazy-sounding philanthropic organizations.", "These are mostly run by women, who are totally incapable of running a charity.", "Chicks, man.", "One of these women, Mrs. Pardiggle, comes to visit.", "She is uptight, severe, loud, obnoxious, self-righteous, and of course totally uncaring.", "She is another woman who domineers over her husband.", "Her charity is done close to home, and she drags her poor kids around to all her activities .", "She is beyond horrible.", "Mrs. Pardiggle invites Esther and Ada on a mission to visit a neighborhood slum to confront a brickmaker.", "As Esther predicts, this mostly involves condescendingly yelling at him for not going to church as he sits with his family .", "The guy is totally unmoved and tells Mrs. Pardiggle off.", "Esther is sad at the hostility of the situation and how there is no way these two people could ever communicate with or understand each other.", "After Mrs. Pardiggle leaves, Esther and Ada try to help the brickmaker's wife with the seemingly sick baby she's holding.", "As soon as they come closer, though, they realize that the baby is dead.", "Yowza!", "Ava loses it and starts to cry, which makes the wife cry too.", "A friend of hers rushes into the house, hugs Jenny, and slowly shushes her to sleep.", "The friend tells Esther and Ava that Jenny held the baby for seven days straight while it was sick.", "The girls leave the two poor women alone, and Esther marvels at the fact that poor people are apparently able to have close friendships and normal human emotions.", "There's a lot of this \"Poor people - they're just like us!\"", "stuff in much of Dickens's writing.", "It sounds wacko now, but it was a pretty novel message in his day and age, before the creation of the kinds of social support systems we rely on today.", "Esther apologizes for spending so much time talking about herself.", "To which the answer is obviously \"Huh?\"", "- since in reality she is constantly leaving herself out or putting herself down.", "So this is just more of that.", "Richard and Ada are falling in love.", "No worries, back then it was totally cool for cousins to get together.", "And it doesn't seem like they're first cousins or anything.", "In any case, Esther thinks it's adorable.", "Such a cute couple!", "But she is also worried about Richard's idiotic rationalizations about money.", "He is not a saver.", "After some time, Jarndyce gets a letter and is psyched to announce that his childhood friend Lawrence Boythorn is coming to visit.", "They met at school, when Boythorn saved Jarndyce from some bullies.", "Jarndyce says Boythorn is large, loud, brave, very emphatic, and generally awesome.", "Boythorn arrives late and bursts into the house yelling about some jerk who gave him bad directions.", "He alternates between saying that things are amazingly awesome and that they're terrible and whoever is responsible for them

displaced by the Poles.", "Lithuanians were now the cheaper labor ,and even their jobs are being threatened by the Slovaks, for they are the poorest immigrants yet and will work for very little

a fear of the cold after another boy comes to work with his ears frozen.", "When someone else tries to warm them, they break off and fall from his head.", "There is no heat in the factories, so men on the killing beds often stick their freezing feet into the warm dead carcasses of the cattle to warm them.", "The steam rising from the killing floor means that men often cannot see five feet in front of them, which makes cutting and butchering the cattle very dangerous work.", "Outside of the factories are saloons.", "These places offer the men a hot meal on their lunch breaks with the condition

looking for a job.", "Jurgis's work on the killing beds has also moved to a grinding pace.", "Often, cattle do not start coming down the chutes until ten or eleven in the morning.", "Sometimes they do not come until one or two o'clock in the afternoon.", "Because it is the rule that all cattle bought must be slaughtered on the same day, it often means that the workers are forced to stay at the factory until midnight or one in the morning to finish the work.", "The worst part is that men are paid only for the work that they do.", "Therefore, if a man is standing around on the cold killing-floor, waiting for the cattle buyers to send cattle to be slaughtered, that man does not earn any money.", "Likewise, men do not get paid if they do not work a full hour.", "At the end of the day, the floor bosses often try and work the men for fifty minutes, just under an hour.", "This means the men do not get paid for that work.", "There is great tension between the workers and the floor

where the scraps are \"tanked\": boiled and rendered so that all the extra fat can be skimmed off for lard and soap.", "Elsewhere, there are guys who are taking apart the chilled pig carcasses: \"Splitters,\" guys who make the most money in the whole factory.", "These fellows do nothing all day except chop hog bodies down the middle.", "\"Cleaver men,\" who quarter these hog bodies and send the different parts of the pig down different chutes for different processing .", "Different rooms contain workers making salt pork and bacon.", "At the doors of these rooms are delivery men waiting with trucks to bring all of these different animal products to the freight train stations for delivery across the country.", "At last, they are at the ground floor of the hog slaughterhouse.", "So Jurgis and his family head across to the cattle slaughterhouses, run by the Durham company.", "Cattle slaughtering happens all on one floor, and it's like a circus watching all of these people with their perfectly timed, interlocking jobs.", "The Durham company runs numerous factories on this spot: it's not just a slaughterhouse; they also make their own cans to store the lard they sell, and they have their own generators.", "Not only that, but these slaughtered cattle aren't just turned into meat: they become leather, glue, fertilizer, soap, and lard.", "Jokubas explains to his friends that these Chicago stockyards support the largest number of workers ever collected in one place for a single industry: 250,000 people directly depend on these plants for their livelihood.", "Its products feed 30 million.", "Jurgis is enchanted.", "He feels honored to have become a part of this enormous enterprise.", "Jurgis reports for work at 7:00 AM the next morning.", "He is so new to this whole working thing that, since he was told to report at the door, he doesn't go inside.", "He waits for two hours at the Brown's factory door.", "His boss only discovers Jurgis waiting at the door when he goes out to find another employee, since it appears that Jurgis hasn't shown up for work.", "The boss yells at Jurgis, but Jurgis doesn't understand English, so none of it sinks in.", "Then the boss leads Jurgis to his new duties on the slaughterhouse killing floors.", "The boss hands Jurgis a \"besom\" - the kind of broom you see witches riding in old movies, with a bunch of thin sticks tied to a long wooden handle.", "Jurgis is supposed to take this broom and sweep up the slaughtered cattle's guts into a trapdoor in the floor, to keep them out of the way.", "Even though this job is disgusting, Jurgis is so excited to be employed that he doesn't even care.", "He is delighted that he has worked a ten hour day and made a whole buck fifty!", "Now, before you go thinking that a dollar fifty was a huge fortune in 1906, even then, it would've been worth about $34.00 .", "This means that Jurgis is getting paid about $3.40 per hour during this 10-hour work day - almost three dollars per hour less than current New York minimum wage.", "When Jurgis gets home, he finds that Teta Elzbieta's brother Jonas has also apparently been given a job.", "Marija Berczynskas has also found work painting ads on sealed cans of smoked beef.", "So everyone is psyched: three people in the family have work, and Jurgis thinks that will be enough to keep Teta Elzbieta and Ona at home to keep house.", "Jurgis wants his father to be able to rest, too.", "But, unfortunately, they need his potential paycheck.", "Antanas also insists that he needs a job.", "Sadly, though, none of the meatpacking plants will employ anyone elderly.", "During the day, Jurgis finds a sign translated into Polish, German, and, most importantly, Lithuanian.", "This sign advertises homes for sale.", "Jurgis gets really excited and brings the sign home with him.", "He shows the ad to his family and suggests that they should buy a house.", "Ona explains further: apparently, the total cost of the house would be $1,500.", "But they only need to pay $300 up front.", "After that, they would keep paying $12 to pay down their mortgage.", "They can't find an apartment for less than $9 a month, so it's not like $12 is so much more.", "Sure, it seems expensive, but there are twelve of them, and they have to think of the future.", "The family talks it over: if they pool together all of their savings, they could come up with the first payment.", "For the rest of it, they have jobs, right?", "Their futures are secure, right?", "Right?", "Marija, Ona, and Teta Elzbieta all go the next day to look at an example of the kind of house they are hoping to buy.", "The agent gives them a hard sell: he says that the company is about to close down, so they have to make their decision right now.", "They'll never see such low, low prices anywhere else.", "Availability is also a problem: with such cheap houses and so many buyers to choose from, the agent isn't even sure they have one left.", "Act now, or regret it forever!", "So, they decide to act now and agree to look at one of the agent's unsold lots later in the week, when the menfolk are off work.", "Meanwhile, Jurgis is working his butt off and clearing $1.75 a day.", "Ona looks at Jurgis, Marija, and Jonas's wages and figures that they'll be able to make their house payments and leave $70.00 per month to feed and clothe their family of twelve.", "So, on Sunday morning, the whole family troops off to see their new house.", "The agent who meets them talks quickly and keeps them from asking too many questions about the property or the neighborhood.", "They are all a little disappointed in the actual house, which doesn't much resemble the model home Teta Elzbieta, Ona, and Marija saw earlier in the week.", "None of the family want to appear ungrateful to the agent, so they don't express their unhappiness over the fact that neither the basement nor the attic are finished rooms.", "What's more, the neighborhood seems empty and poorly kept - nothing like the bustling neighborhood the agent led them to believe they would enjoy.", "Even though they want to show their appreciation to the agent, even this family isn't naive enough to put their money down right away.", "They struggle with this huge home purchase for almost a week before Jurgis finally decides they have to take the risk.", "They know they should look at other houses, but they don't have any idea where to begin looking for houses for sale.", "So they tell the agent they're ready to make a deal.", "Jokubas Szedvilas offers to accompany \"the women\" to the deed signing the next day; Jurgis can't come because he has to work.", "Everyone is quite frightened, because they are worried about being cheated.", "Jokubas Szedvilas begins to read the deed.", "He gets confused because the contract is in legalese - not in plain English.", "Still, Jokubas can't help but notice that the contract uses the term rental.", "It seems as though what they're actually signing is not a property deed, but a rental contract.", "If they keep renting the house for eight years and four months, then they will own it.", "Teta Elzbieta totally freaks out and protests that they can't sign such an agreement.", "The agent brings in a lawyer to back him up.", "The lawyer examines the contract and says everything is on the up and up, but Teta Elzbieta can't be sure the agent's lawyer can be trusted.", "Jokubas asks the agent and the lawyer question after question, clarifying that he is not cheating them and that this really is a property deed.", "And then Jokubas turns to Teta Elzbieta and asks what she wants to do.", "Teta Elzbieta takes out the money and lays it on the table.", "They take the deed, but no one feels happy about it.", "When they all gather in the evening and show Jurgis the deed, he is furious.", "He is sure they have been cheated.", "Jurgis rushes to Jokubas's house to ask his help to find another lawyer to see if they can break the contract.", "Jokubas brings them to a lawyer.", "This second lawyer agrees that everything is in order.", "This language about \"rentals\" is just a formal legal thing that makes it easier for the agent's company to evict them if they stop paying their monthly fees.", "But as long as they keep paying the house will be theirs.", "Jurgis is so relieved that he pays the lawyer's fees without any hesitation.", "When he rushes home, he finds everyone in the household freaking out: they had all believed that Jurgis was going off to murder the agent.", "Even though it seems that all is OK now, Ona and Teta Elzbieta's nerves are running so high that they cry all night long.", "They've bought their house, so now they need to find some furniture to put in it.", "They've only got three days before their deal with Mrs. Jukniene is over, so they have to get right to it.", "Luckily, Packingtown is papered with advertisements for pretty much everything in the world.", "One of these ads offers all the furniture you could need to fill a four-room space .", "This furniture comes at the low, low price of $75.00.", "And the absolute best part?", "You don't have to pay all at once!", "You can pay a down payment and then a few dollars a month.", "So they decide that they need furniture, they're really poor right now, and this is their best bet.", "They carry all of their new furniture, delivered to Mrs. Jukniene's apartment, to their new house by hand.", "They all feel full of hope: Jurgis and Ona stay up late thinking happily that they can finally get married as soon as they are settled and have some money saved.", "The dining table sits in the kitchen.", "The dining room is used as a bedroom for Teta Elzbieta and five of her children.", "Ona and Marija sleep in the living room, on a mattress they keep in another room during the day.", "Jonas, Jurgis, Antanas, and Stanislovas sleep in the fourth room, on the floor.", "Jurgis is working harder than he ever has before.", "When he admired the machine-like precision of the slaughterhouse laborers before, he hadn't realized how physically exhausting the pace of their work really is.", "Still, Jurgis enjoys the challenge.", "What surprises Jurgis is that his pleasure in the work at the slaughterhouse is not popular.", "To his amazement, he discovers that most of the men at the factory hate their work and the neighborhood they live in.", "Jurgis can't understand it, but all of his colleagues tell him just to wait and see.", "Jurgis also doesn't understand unions.", "They don't have unions where he comes from, so he doesn't get what rights for workers might mean.", "Jurgis discovers that the unions are trying to lobby to get the factory to slow down the rate of production.", "It's too fast, and it's killing some of their workers.", "Jurgis thinks this is just lazy.", "He knows that every man has to keep up, or he'll be left behind.", "What's more, Jurgis will not pay his union dues.", "So Jurgis absolutely refuses to unionize.", "There's a reference to Malthus in the eleventh paragraph of this chapter.", "Malthus is an eighteenth-century English economist who projected that rising populations would inevitably cause more famine and disease among the lower classes.", "He felt that family size among poor people should be regulated by the government .", "By referring to Malthus in this particular paragraph, Sinclair is making the point that plenty of people agree with Malthus's ideas on paper while still feeling personally that we should assist the starving poor with aid money.", "Jurgis is like the guy who believes in Malthus but still thinks there should be a relief fund for starving people.", "He talks a hard line about working people, that if you can't stand the heat, stay out of the kitchen.", "Antanas has worked hard his whole life; he wants to do nothing but work.", "But he has gone to every single packing plant and shop in Packingtown, and absolutely no one will give such an old man a job.", "Antanas's difficulties are Jurgis's first sign that all is not perfect in America after all.", "Jurgis grows even more suspicious when Antanas is finally offered a job.", "A man approaches Antanas directly and asks what Antanas would pay to be employed.", "The man wants one third of Antanas's salary if he gets Antanas a job.", "Jurgis hears about this offer and goes to consult a friend of his from the killing floor, Tamoszius Kuszleika .", "Tamoszius Kuszleika says that this is common; this guy who approached Antanas is just a go-between for a boss who is looking to make a little extra money.", "This kind of dishonesty is built into a system in which the management, from the owner of the company right down to the foremen, are trying to make as much money as they can for themselves.", "Jurgis is shaken by Tamoszius Kuszleika's statements, but he still doesn't believe that the system is so rotten.", "Jurgis asks Antanas not to take this job, but Antanas is so desperate that he does it anyway.", "Antanas's job is in a \"pickle room\" where meat is brined .", "He is a \"squeedgie man,\" mopping up the floor.", "Antanas quickly learns to loathe his job.", "What disgusts Antanas is the filthiness of the meatpacking conditions.", "The men in the \"pickle room\" lay slabs of meat in vats of brine .", "After the men pack up their beef into trucks for delivery to the canning stations, Antanas has to mop the discarded brine into a hole in the floor.", "There is a sink under the hole that collects this used brine so that it can be recycled for the next batch of preserved meats.", "It's recycled on and on - they never use new brine.", "What is more, the pipe that leads from this hole in the floor to a sink in the room below also has a trap to catch refuse.", "Antanas has to clean out this trap, which contains scraps of meat and trash.", "But instead of throwing these odds and ends away, every few days, Antanas is supposed to shovel these filthy scraps into the trucks with the rest of the meat.", "Marija Berczynskas, meanwhile, has found out how exactly she got her job painting can labels.", "She has made a friend at the factory,

job.", "Finally, their boss, the \"forelady\" - a low-level manager - decided that Mary's sickness was throwing off her performance.", "So the forelady fired her, point-blank, with no concern for how

the way of an out-of-control cart once and was crushed to death against the factory wall.", "Jurgis starts seeing some pretty horrible things at his work, too.", "Remember, Jurgis shovels guts off the killing beds into a trapdoor in the floor.", "Apparently, cows that are about to give birth or who have just had a calf are not edible.", "It would be perfectly easy for the meatpackers to keep these

the cheap, without caring about anything except the outside appearance, and then mark up the cost thirty times over.", "The whole point of this real estate scam is to attract people who have just enough money for the huge down payment, but not enough to keep up with the monthly payments.", "Once they miss one monthly payment, the whole family will be evicted.", "And then the company will be

in that house has had at least one member who has caught tuberculosis.", "Grandmother Majauszkiene continues her list of horrors: she points out that children in this area often get sick because they have to go to work so young.", "The law may say you can only start work at sixteen, but there is no enforcement, and the meatpacking plants are always happy to hire kids who will do the same work as an adult for a third of the money.", "The family members hearing all of this are shocked - they don't really understand about tuberculosis, but they have noticed that Antanas has been coughing solidly for the last two weeks.", "The worst thing that Grandmother Majauszkiene has to tell them is about interest: she informs them that their monthly payment is $12 not including interest.", "They had no idea that their payments would also include interest on the money they still owe .", "They bring their house deed to Grandmother Majauszkiene to examine, and she points out one line that they had missed, demanding 7% monthly interest.", "So, the upshot is that they don't just have to pay $12 per month; they have to pay $7 on top of that.", "The family begins to cry out in agony: they are sure

the cold.", "Finally, he will only leave for work in the morning if Jurgis will take him through the snow.", "Jurgis often has to carry him on his shoulders.", "And since Stanislovas refuses to go home by himself, he will almost freeze to death waiting for Jurgis.", "The killing beds are also unheated.", "The men who handle knives can't wear gloves, which numbs their hands and makes them more likely to have accidents.", "What makes all of this so unpleasant is that there is nowhere to eat.", "Jurgis has two choices: he can either eat his meals surrounded by the stench of the stockyards, or

shorter and shorter working hours during the winter.", "This means Jurgis is bringing in less and less money, even though he's still working hard.", "There is usually a rush at the end of the day when they have to work double-time to process all of the cattle that have come in during the day.", "Jurgis sometimes has to stay on as late as midnight or 1:00 AM.", "The worst thing of all is that the companies do not pay all of Jurgis's working hours.", "If a worker is even a minute late, he will not be paid for that hour he works.", "Still, a worker also gets no extra pay if he comes in early.",

quiet.", "Miss Henderson has close ties to a brothel downtown, and a lot of the girls who work for her are also former prostitutes.", "The reason Miss Henderson hates Ona is because Ona is a \"decent

him, because he absolutely has to work.", "Ona has to work, too - in fact, she goes back to Brown's factory a week after giving birth.", "They leave Baby Antanas in the care of Teta Elzbieta, who feeds him watered down milk from the local grocery store.", "The two of them work even harder so that they can give Baby Antanas a better life than either of them have had.", "Yet, in going straight

workers falls into the rendering tanks and gets processed into lard and fertilizer .", "Still, they are pretty sure that Jonas just got fed up and left - how could he want to stay at his terrible job?", "It's not like he's enjoying a decent home life, with the cold and the crying children.", "So they have no choice but to borrow more money from Marija, who is once again putting off her dreams

his unemployed fellows do, which is to hit the bars everyday.", "Even so, there just isn't work anywhere.", "He tries to use his union connections, and even that gets Jurgis nowhere.", "What makes Jurgis bitter is that it is the system itself that has drained his energy and muscle - when he was fresh from Lithuania, he got hired right away, but now he's damaged goods, and the same factory that

of this time.", "Finally, he realizes that he has no other choice: he has to go to look for work at Durham's fertilizer plant.", "The reason that this is a last resort is that the fertilizer plant is unbelievably unhealthy for its workers: they labor underground processing the bones of cattle and inhaling the fine dust this stuff sends into the air.", "The problem with inhaling this dust is that it is loaded with phosphates.", "Phosphorus is necessary for bone development , but as with any mineral, too much is a bad idea.", "For one thing, phosphates often carry traces of heavy metals that

smell.", "Meat that falls on the floor will be picked up, dusted off, and put back into the grinder.", "Sausage meat also gets stored in huge piles that are kept under leaky ceilings and are overrun with rats, so it's filled with rodent feces and horrifying germs.", "Basically, the sausage production process is absolutely, completely revolting.", "The only way that Teta Elzbieta can stand this work is by letting her mind go dead.", "She stops feeling anything.", "In fact, the whole family has largely fallen silent from misery.", "They realize that it's another full six years before they

new guys to the cause.", "He frequently asks Jurgis to tell them about his experiences in the stockyards.", "Jurgis is reluctant at first, but eventually he realizes that Tommy Hinds doesn't need him

Nicholas Schliemann is a former philosophy professor and nutritionist.", "Schliemann is originally from Switzerland.", "He has his own system for living under capitalism: he earns money working the fields over the summer and uses that money to buy a precise, scientific amount of food to keep him going the rest of the year.", "Jurgis walks in on an argument between Lucas and Schliemann on the value of religion to the socialist cause.", "Lucas believes wholeheartedly in using the Bible to preach about the redistribution of wealth.", "He points out that Jesus stood against the pride, greed, and luxury that wealth brings.", "Was it not Jesus who said, in the Sermon on the Mount: \"Blessed are ye poor, for yours is the kingdom of Heaven\" ?", "Lucas keeps going on and on about Jesus as the first truly class-conscious man.", "Schliemann asks how they can feel free to use the Bible to preach this message when, right now, Christian bishops are accumulating huge wealth on the backs of the working man.", "Mr. Maynard, the east cost magazine editor, asks how it can be that two socialists disagree so actively about what direction to take the party?", "Lucas believes that socialism is a tool to creating a new promised land on Earth, New Jerusalem.", "Schliemann wants to see the centralization of all factories and private property, along with absolute freedom in thought and artistic production.", "Schliemann thinks this would lead to the natural development of communities based on like-minded people who choose to live and associate with one another.", "They would have so much more leisure time if they didn't have to compete with one another for work and there would be real time to devote to art and writing.", "Mr. Maynard wants to know how a society could possibly get by while demanding so little work from its members.", "Schliemann points out that capitalism wastes a lot of work on competition and strife between companies.", "If there was no concern about improving your standard of living, if everyone had enough to get by all right, the average worker would be much less stressed out and overwhelmed.", "After all, look how much each company spends on advertising!", "Without competition, there would be no need for marketing or for lying about the value of goods.", "Under this system, prices could be a lot lower because there would be no profit attached - a book would cost as much as necessary to cover production and no more.", "Schliemann doesn't mean that everyone will get exactly the same things - some people will work harder than others, and some will work less.", "Thus, some will get more than others.", "Still, everyone will be rewarded according to his efforts, and no one will be left behind.", "After the revolution, all of the social ills of ignorance, malnourishment of children, prostitution, and homelessness will be totally eliminated.", "Once labor is no longer figured into the cost of production, people won't have an incentive to do unpleasant work.", "In other words, let's say you were looking at two jobs, and one involved slaughtering cows and one involved growing vegetables.", "You would probably pick the second one unless there you got paid a lot more for the first one.", "But if all labor costs exactly the same thing - if you are paid according to how much you work, no matter what you are making - then there would be no reason ever to pursue a job you really, truly hated.", "This is why Schliemann feels that socialism will mean the end to unsafe labor practices: because factories will have to attract people to work for them.", "The power will all be on the side of the worker, not the factory owner.", "Schliemann predicts that this shift of power will also mean the end to the meatpacking industry as a whole.", "No one is going to choose to be surrounded by many, many slaughtered animals.", "In Schliemann's vision of a future world, we'll all be vegetarians.", "Jurgis overhears two

about this power from the sky.", "He decides that he must learn more, although he is frightened because no one but he knows about it.", "For some reason, he knows more than all the Scholars combined,

the same and leaves, walking backward with her arms still bent, as though they were still holding water.", "Equality 7-2521 is stunned because he has created something new by himself.", "After countless days and failed attempts, he has managed to use the artifacts from the Unmentionable Times to construct a glass box which can harness his previously discovered power of the sky.", "Whenever

Scholar were to find the secret, that person will not understand the significance of the glass box.", "Instead, Equality 7-2521 and his light will be destroyed because of his crime.", "For the first time, he cares not only about the light but about his own survival, because his body and his invention are connected.", "He stretches his arms, feeling their power, and he suddenly wishes to know the

box, he ceases to care about the scars on his back.", "Tomorrow, he plans to take his box to the Home of the Scholars and hand them his journal as a confession.", "He then plans to join them in

house is, or how much jewelry you can buy to fill up the void in your soul.", "Strether says that Maria seems like a big success because she can enjoy life.", "Um, zing?", "She reminds him that he has no clue what kind of ambitions she had when she was younger.", "Which adds to the mystery of the story and the possible dangerousness around Maria, not to mention the whole uncertainty-of-people's

beforehand.", "This is all new to him, and the sight of Maria and the fragrances in the air are almost overwhelming.", "We know, it's like he's going to burst into song.", "But he doesn't, because he's too busy noticing that Maria's dress is way more low-cut than anything Mrs. Newsome would ever wear.", "Then he realizes that no woman ever has had dinner with him before going out to a play.", "And yeah, that makes him think about how he's wasted his life.", "Come to think of it, Lewis Lambert Strether and J. Alfred Prufrock might actually be the same dude.", "We also learn at this point that Strether is a widower.", "He lost his wife many years ago, and ten years after his wife's death, he lost his only son.", "So at least he's got a reason to have a tough time enjoying life.", "He tells Maria about his mission to bring back Chad.", "Maria understands the situation, but asks how the Newsome family can be so sure that Chad has changed for the worse since moving to Europe.", "After all, none of them have actually seen or talked to him since the move.", "Strether goes all Woollett on her and says he can't really understand how someone could be improved by moving away from a family as moral and wholesome as the Newsomes.", "Hello, moral judgment.", "He says he's definitely sure that whoever Chad is involved with must be a terrible woman.", "Maria asks Strether what Chad is like, and Strether answers that he's a stubborn, ignorant young man who's to selfish to realize that he's worrying his mother to death with all of his evil adventures.", "Sounds pretty stick-up-his-Massachussetts to us.", "Maria finally asks Strether what his fiancee, Mrs. Newsome, is like.", "Well, the truth's the truth: they're about the same age so she's no spring chicken in the looks department.", "But he admires her for her grace and intelligence.", "Nice save, Streth.", "He admits that her daughter Sarah can be tough to get along with.", "In fact, he admits that he is a little bit afraid of her.", "Boy, this is like gold for the gossip column.", "Maria asks why Mrs. Newsome hasn't come to get Chad herself, but Strether says that Mrs. Newsome is almost an invalid who can't leave the house because she's not in great health.", "Like we said, no spring chicken.", "Don't forget, this is in 1903 so airports didn't have moving walkways yet.", "In fact, the first successful airplane got airborne that very year, so they weren't so much doing commercial flights yet.", "Back to the convo: Maria has also begun to wonder how Strether is funding his trip if he's not so successful back in America.", "She ventures a guess that dear Mrs. Newsome has a lot of money.", "Not to be forward, or anything.", "Lo and behold, Strether confirms that his fiancee is quite wealthy, and that Chad will be too if he comes home to manage the family business.", "But he adds that things are at a crossroads.", "If Chad wants to make a lot of money and run the business, it has to be right away.", "Basically, the family is done waiting for him.", "If he doesn't hightail it back, they'll hand the management of the business to someone else.", "Maria, not batting a lash about her nosiness, asks where the Newsomes' money comes from.", "Strether gets a little shy about this and says that they've made all of their money by manufacturing a certain type of everyday object that he won't name.", "Why he won't name it, Maria asks?", "Strether says it's a fairly embarrassing thing to talk about.", "As readers, we should all be racking our brains wondering what object Strether could possibly be talking about.", "Strether says it's a \"small, trivial, rather ridiculous object\" .", "So like, a plunger?", "Mops?", "The 1903 version of tampons?", "What could it be?", "Like us, Maria tries a few guesses, but Strether tells her she's not even close.", "He says he'll tell her the next time they meet.", "But for now, he just wants to enjoy the theatre and not think about the unnamed object.", "This thing must be really weird.", "Or at least, people in that era were.", "Now Maria wants to know why Strether wouldn't take over the business without Chad around.", "Strether says he isn't really the business type.", "Instead, he's the editor of a small magazine that Mrs. Newsome funds, sort of as a charity project.", "So Strether is pretty much totally in her debt.", "Strether admits that having his name on the cover of this magazine as an editor is a tiny bit of compensation for all of the hopes and dreams he feels haven't come true in his life.", "Single tear.", "Returning to the subject of Chad, Strether says that the young man ignores all letters from his family.", "No wonder he gets such a bad rap.", "That's why he has come over to get him personally.", "Maria suggests that one of two things has probably happened to Chad: he's either become a terrible man or he's become more refined.", "Strether has never even considered this second possibility and finds it absurd.", "Strether also mentions that Chad's family wants to bring him home so they can marry him off to a virtuous young woman named Mamie Pocock, the sister-in-law of Chad's sister, Sarah.", "Pocock?", "Strether says that Mamie is much admired back in Woollett and is a very pretty and refined girl.", "He believes that Mamie will be able to save Chad's soul.", "Maria has a sudden revelation, and she says that she thinks Strether is too good for the people around him.", "He dismisses this because the dude just can't take a compliment.", "Or is kind of in denial.", "When the evening is over, Strether puts Maria into a cab .", "He asks if he can ride with her, but she refuses.", "Ah, the wonderful dance of flirting... not that Strether would ever admit to himself that this is what he's doing.", "By this point, Strether has made it to Paris.", "He pops into a place where he's supposed to receive some letters from America.", "He hasn't.", "He's kind of bummed about it.", "He's such an anxious dude that he's worried about doing anything in Paris--namely enjoying himself in any way--without some sort of permission from Mrs. Newsome in a letter.", "Yeah, the dude's starting to sound a little whipped.", "As a sort of self-punishment, he hangs out with Waymarsh for the rest of the day.", "The next day in Paris, there are letters, and Strether greedily reads them.", "But he also wants to find an ideal place to read and respond to the letters, so he spends a good chunk of his afternoon wandering around Paris and looking for seats in cafes.", "Yeah, that can take up a whole bunch of pages when you're Henry James.", "He finally finds a spot in some public gardens and sits down in a chair to read.", "Meanwhile, he's been drinking in all the beautiful sights of Paris.", "The air is sweeter than back home, the birds sing more beautifully, the trees...well, you get the picture.", "Mrs. Newsome's letters say that she doesn't want him to worry about anything that's not connected to his mission of bringing back Chad.", "The whole order not to worry thing gives him a huge sense of freedom that helps him enjoy the sights of Paris even more, since now he feels like he has permission to do so.", "Strether also realizes just how weary he was when he left America.", "He feels rejuvenated by being able to walk around Paris alone.", "But not everything is happy for him.", "He also can't enjoy Paris without thinking about how he's wasted his life being an anxious, play-it-safe kind of guy.", "Finally, Strether is able to admit to himself what he actually thinks: he's envious that Chad gets to live as a young, wealthy bachelor in this kind of city.", "Chad mentioned in some of his past letters that he'd become friends with a group of super cool artists living in Paris, and Strether just can't bear how jealous he is.", "But he also reminds himself that Chad is sleeping around, and this is something Strether could never envy because it's immoral...heh heh.", "During one of his walks, Strether comes to the building where Chad is supposed to be living.", "He knows that Chad's giant apartment is up on the third floor, and as he glances up, Strether sees a young man staring down at him from the third floor balcony.", "He's a little freaked by the fact that he's been watched, but he also realizes that this young man isn't Chad, but some other guy hanging out in his apartment.", "And we just have to find out who this dude is.", "What if he's murdered Chad and stolen his identity?", "We'll just have to keep reading to find out.", "Now we find Strether back at his hotel having some grub with Waymarsh, who's being stern as usual.", "But Strether doesn't mind so much because, glory be, he's just had the most wonderful adventure.", "He picks up his story where we left off, and tells Waymarsh about what happened after he saw the young man looking down at him from Chad's apartment.", "It turns out that the young man let Strether in and brought him up to the apartment.", "Yeah, not as exciting as the murder version.", "Anyway, Strether's blown away even just remembering all the beautiful things that were in the apartment.", "It turns out that the young man is a starving artist named Bilham who's a friend of Chad's.", "Chad is out of town at the moment, and he has lent his apartment to Bilham while he's gone because Bilham really appreciates the opportunity to live in a rich friend's home for a bit.", "We're skeptical.", "As for our pal Strether, he doesn't necessarily trust the guy at first, but soon warms up to him.", "Waymarsh only wants the juicy details, so he comes right out and asks if Chad is living in his apartment with a woman.", "Strether can only say that he doesn't know.", "He also doesn't know if Chad has taken a woman with him on his trip or whether he'll come back with one.", "So Waymarsh just gets frustrated and asks what the heck Strether does know after his trip to Chad's pad.", "Strether closes the story by mentioning that he's been invited to breakfast by the Bilham guy.", "Waymarsh can't believe that Strether would even entertain the idea of dining with such immoral people.", "But Strether reminds Waymarsh that they don't actually know anything about these people.", "At this point, Strether tells Waymarsh what his deal actually is: if he gets Chad to come home with him, Mrs. Newsome will marry him.", "If he fails, he might lose his sugar mama.", "The next morning, Strether gets ready to head to breakfast with Bilham.", "Waymarsh says it's a dumb idea, but since he doesn't have any other friends, he begrudgingly comes along.", "At breakfast, Strether and Waymarsh sit down in Chad's apartment with Bilham and a young woman named Miss Barrace.", "Strether immediately suspects that this woman might be the one who's living with Chad and turning him against his family, because hey, he'll pretty much suspect any lady at this point.", "Strangely enough, Miss Barrace takes a shining to Waymarsh.", "She thinks he's a wonderful specimen of a stereotypical American.", "By the way, that's nothing like today's stereotypical American.", "Back in those days, everyone thought of Americans as stuck-up prudes.", "During the meal, Strether notes that Miss Barrace and Bilham don't have the best table manners.", "But he doesn't really care because he's fascinated by the fact that they don't.", "They seem to not really mind what other people think of them, and this is astounding to Strether.", "Like we said, pretty different from today's stereotypes of Americans.", "Strether is also blown away to hear these people say that Chad Newsome is pretty much the greatest guy in the world.", "Strether planned on coming to Paris and finding a monster.", "But he's getting more convinced by the minute that Chad might be a good guy with a good life.", "Miss Maria Gostrey arrives in Paris a week after Strether and Waymarsh have gotten there.", "Again, coincidence?", "We think, um, maybe.", "Strether wastes no time in going to pay a call.", "There's no denying that Strether feels a deep intimacy with Maria: \"The circle in which they stood together was warm with life, and every question between them would live there as nowhere else\" .", "That's deep stuff, yo!", "Strether confesses to Maria that he's done something terrible: he's become friends with the little artist named Bilham.", "He's consorting with the enemy!", "Miss Gostrey says she'd like to meet Bilham, and Strether thinks this is a great idea.", "He also admits that since arriving in Paris, he hasn't found out a single thing about Chad's life that deserves criticism.", "That could also be just lack of 411, since he still doesn't know if Chad's living with a woman.", "Fast forward to when Maria first meets Bilham.", "She leans into Strether and says not to worry; Bilham is \"one of us.\"", "Strether doesn't totally understand what Maria means by this, but it's pretty obvious that she's including him in the same category as her and Bilham: they're all people who seek something more in life than the prudes back in America.", "Strether's pretty keen on this whole belonging idea, and once more, he gets sucked a little deeper into the world of Paris and its amusements.", "Strether suddenly realizes what makes the artist Bilham such a cool guy: he looks at the world without any kind of prejudice.", "Americans like Waymarsh and the Newsomes are always judging everything they encounter to see whether they're good or bad.", "The idea of being unprejudiced and of judging things fairly is a totally new idea to Strether.", "A few days later, Strether gets a letter from Maria saying that she has box seats to the Paris theatre.", "Lucky for him, his only job is to hang out in Paris until Chad shows up, so he goes with her.", "Of course, Waymarsh is going to tag along, too.", "At the theatre, the three of them discuss Bilham.", "Strether talks him up, but Waymarsh says that the kid is an unmanned and uncivilized brute.", "Ouch.", "Strether is pained by this judgment because it shows him just how far apart he and Waymarsh have grown since coming to Europe.", "What happened to the whole not-judging-folks thing?", "Maria suddenly suggests to Strether that Chad might intentionally be out of town in order to let Strether spend some time wandering around Paris.", "Chad and Bilham might have a conspiracy to turn Strether into one of them.", "In which case, Maria adds, it totally seems to be working.", "Conspiracy theorists are pretty much applauding in their chairs at this point.", "Before they can get too deep into the theorizing, the door of their box opens and a gentleman walks in.", "This is what the lit industry calls uncannily perfect timing.", "Plus, the play is just starting up again, so none of them can say anything to the intruder.", "Oh, the suspense!", "In case it wasn't totally obvious, Strether realizes with a gasp that their visitor is actually Chad Newsome.", "Surprise!", "Simply put, Strether is won over even more based on Chad's impressive and shockingly sophisticated appearance.", "The guy who Strether still thinks of as a cocky young boy now has some grey streaks in his hair and carries himself like a very dignified theatre-goer.", "Think high school guys and nerd-pot Strether just spotted the jockiest of jocks.", "His buddy Waymarsh, though, isn't impressed, and he just glowers at Chad from his seat.", "Waymarsh be darned, Strether suddenly become self-conscious about how he must look to Chad.", "After all, Strether wants to be a cool guy too.", "Strether spends the rest of the play obsessing over everything he now knows about Chad and his super cool Paris life.", "And better yet, there seems to be nothing in Chad's life that is morally questionable.", "There's no sign of any \"evil\" woman in his life, and all of his friends are cool artists.", "There's a lot of assumption going on here.", "Strether knows that he needs to write a letter back to Mrs. Newsome in Woollett.", "But he has no clue what to say.", "He knows that he better not write back bragging about how much Chad has flourished since leaving his boring family behind.", "What to do?", "Strether scribbles home a few sparse details and keeps his gushing to himself.", "\"Chad has grey hair now,\" is about as descriptive as he gets.", "Just what an anxious sugar mama wants to hear.", "The first words we read in this chapter are Strether telling Chad that the good times in Paris are over and that it's time to come back to Woollett.", "Although you can tell that Strether is having a tough time saying this.", "Chad acts as if he knows Strether was going to say this, and he just brushes it off.", "Instead, he asks Strether if his engagement to Chad's mother is a done deal yet?", "It's like he knows the stakes of Strether's trip and is teasing him about it.", "Then Chad comes out and says it: he knows that Strether knows that Strether had come to all the way to gay Par-ee to drag Chad back to Woolett as a big, grey-haired wedding present for Mrs. Newsome.", "Even though they both know that Chad is better off in Paris.", "How to react to a zinger like that?", "Always the tact-master, Strether says he's tired and would like to go to bed.", "Chad says he has more questions to ask.", "But Strether is pretty strict about his beddy bye time, so he tells Chad it'll have to wait.", "Chad has kept him waiting for days, so now it's Strether's turn to return the favor.", "Oh, the devious little power moves of everyday conversation.", "Chad decides to walk Strether back to his hotel so the two of them can talk on the way.", "While they walk, he asks Strether what kinds of details he'll be reporting back to Mrs. Newsome.", "He has a guess or two about what the family has probably imagined about his Paris life.", "At this moment, Strether thinks of a word that perfectly describes Chad's vibe to him--pagan.", "In other words, the Christian way of looking at the world is to judge everything in terms of moral goodness or badness .", "But Chad is more the do-what-you-want-as-long-as-it-doesn't-hurt-anyone type.", "As they come up to Strether's hotel, Strether asks Chad if he's living with a woman.", "Chad doesn't give a yes or nor answer, but only asks what difference it makes.", "Well, kind of a lot, since Strether's from the non-pagan side of things.", "Basically the whole point of the trip was to find this out.", "Just to keep Strether grasping at straws, Chad says that if he wanted to go home, no woman would ever have the power to keep him in Paris.", "Yes, it's not much of an answer.", "But it does explain to Strether that it's Chad's choice not to come home.", "Chad says that the reason he doesn't come home is simply because he likes Paris and because Woollett is boring.", "This gives Strether more to think about in terms of his own life.", "Let the drama continue.", "For the next ten days, Strether and Chad hang out and walk around Paris together.", "No matter how highly he thinks of Chad and Paris, though, Strether knows he can't let any of his good impressions show up in his letters back to Woollett.", "So, all he says is that there's no woman in Chad's life, although he knows that this will just prompt the inevitable question from Mrs. Newsome: well, what's keeping the two of you there?", "Strether buys himself some more time in Paris by saying that Chad will come back with him after he clears up some business.", "It's a gamble, but Strether wants a bit more vacay.", "Maria Gostrey tells Strether that she's not so sure about the idea that there's no woman in Chad's life.", "She said she could tell within five seconds of meeting the guy that there's something else keeping him in Paris, and she's pretty sure that something wears petticoats.", "Strether asks Maria if that'd mean that this woman is too bad for Chad to even admit to.", "But Maria says maybe it's the opposite: she might be too good for him to admit to, because she would make Chad's family feel inferior.", "According to know-it-all Maria, that's why Chad might keep the woman a secret.", "Strether can't believe that Chad wouldn't acknowledge a woman who's played a big part in turning him into a gentleman.", "But Maria ends the conversation by telling Strether that Chad isn't as good a guy as Strether might think.", "Yep, more suspense, more not speaking straightforwardly.", "Meanwhile, Strether continues to write vague letters back to Woollett to stall Mrs. Newsome and the rest of her nosy clan.", "One day, Chad invites Strether, Maria, and Waymarsh for tea at a fancy place called the Boulevard de Malesherbes.", "How lovely.", "After tea, Strether goes for a walk with Bilham and asks him what Chad's \"game\" is.", "He knows there's some sort of deception going on, and he wants Bilham to come out and explain it.", "But Bilham is totally shifty on this question.", "He says that what Chad wants most of all is to be free to enjoy his new and improved self.", "Strether keeps on asking whether this means that Chad's seeing a woman or not, but Bilham won't come clean one way or the other.", "At least, not until he does.", "Bilham finally comes out and says there is someone in Chad's life, but that it's a \"virtuous attachment.\"", "Strether has no problem buying the idea that Chad has a platonic, non-sexual relationship with someone in Paris.", "Which is totally fine as far as he's concerned.", "It turns out that Chad's \"virtuous attachment\" is to two women, a mother and daughter.", "Which is also fine, according to Strether.", "Though he is curious about whether the daughter is old enough to marry Chad, and has no clue how old either one is.", "Strether also speculates with Maria Gostrey that maybe Chad is in love with a woman who doesn't love him back.", "This would explain why he won't leave Paris.", "The question that remains is whether Chad's in love with the mother or the daughter.", "For the first time since way back at the beginning of the book, Strether brings up Mamie .", "He thinks that Mamie is prettier than any of the women he's met in Paris.", "At this point, Strether also lets slip that he hasn't mentioned his new \"friendship\" with Maria in any of his letters back to Woollett.", "We all know what that means.", "For the first time, Strether starts to wonder if Bilham flat out lied to him when he said Chad's attachment was virtuous.", "He realizes that he's still going to have to do some more sleuthing into Chad's life before he gets the concrete answers he wants.", "The next Sunday, Chad brings Strether to see a famous artist named the Great Gloriani.", "It turns out that this artist likes to have big parties at his place on Sunday afternoons, and it's a pretty exclusive clique that gets to go to them.", "Strether is pumped.", "Strether also learns that the female duo whom Chad is attached to will be at the party.", "Their names are Madame and Mademoiselle de Vionnet.", "Strether is stunned by the beauty of the Great Gloriani's property , and he immediately has a sense of how old, historic, and authentic it is compared to the \"new world\" .", "But what's even more impressive to Strether is how easily Chad gets along with this bunch of rich and famous people.", "The man doesn't seem to feel any anxiety at all, which is something the ever-anxious Strether envies a lot.", "Strether gets separated from Chad and runs into Bilham again.", "Bilham says that the artist Gloriani is always nice to all the starving, down-and-out artists living in Paris who aren't as great as he is.", "Strether admits his fear that he's boring and average compared to the people at the party, but Bilham argues that Strether is, in fact, a huge novelty to these people.", "As an average American, he's one of the most interesting people amongst this crowd of European aristocrats and artists.", "Who woulda thunk?", "After that little confidence boost, Strether asks if Madame de Vionnet and her daughter have arrived, since he's curious to get a look at them.", "Strether learns that Madame de Vionnet is still married and her husband is alive, so he figures that Chad's attachment must be to the daughter .", "Bilham more or less says that yes, Chad is in love with the daughter.", "But this just makes Strether wonder why the two of them aren't together.", "But Bilham just answers this question with a string of more question, which basically delays Strether until Miss Barrace comes over to say what's up.", "She also says she's left Miss Gostrey in the house with Waymarsh .", "It turns out Miss Barrace is still totally charmed by what a cranky dude Waymarsh is.", "It's like she enjoys him ironically, kind of how a hipster would enjoy a moth-eaten grandpa sweater.", "Bilham and Miss Barrace suddenly express their fondness for how much everyone shows of themselves in Paris.", "Strether wants to know if people show themselves for who they really are, but Bilham and Barrace treat the category of \"real\" as though it isn't all that important, as long as life is entertaining.", "Strether wants to know what Miss Barrace thinks of Madame de Vionnet, but she thinks it's better if he asks de Vionnet himself.", "The lady herself is now at the party, and it's time for Strether to meet her.", "And it only took five and a half books to get there!", "When he meets Madame de Vionnet, Strether is struck by how youthful she seems for a woman with a daughter in her late teens.", "The woman is wearing a black dress and speaks in odd-sounding, but perfectly grammatical English.", "So far so good.", "There's no sign yet of the woman's daughter, who's probably hanging out somewhere else in the house.", "But Strether's got his hands full with the mom, anyway.", "It turns out that de Vionnet is old friends with Maria Gostrey, who seems to know just about everyone in all of Europe.", "The meeting isn't long, but it makes a really good impression on Strether.", "Afterwards, he goes to sit on a garden bench by himself and to collect his thoughts about what exactly is going on in Chad's life.", "Not his own, because that would be, like, pagan or something.", "While he's sitting, little Bilham plops down beside him.", "The only thing Strether can say is that it's a shame Madame de Vionnet's husband is still alive, though it's not clear for whose benefit he's saying this.", "Not the most Christian of sentiments, if you ask us.", "Strether then launches into a passionate speech, telling Bilham that no matter what he does with his life, he needs to enjoy his years of youth.", "Strether is depressed now to realize just how much he's missing out on by living his dusty, dull life in Woollett.", "Bilham tries to soothe him by saying that he'd like to be just like Strether when he gets older.", "Aw.", "Strether isn't ready to be consoled so easily, though.", "He says he'd rather be, at his age, an interesting and famous person like the artist Gloriani.", "At this point, Chad walks up to them with Jeanne de Vionnet, the girl whom he is apparently in love with.", "Strether is struck by how young and beautiful she is, and feels like poor Woollett and its Mamies just can't compete with a cultured, beautiful French girl like Jeanne.", "Their meeting is brief, but Jeanne takes the opportunity to extend Strether an invitation to come visit her mother at their house.", "Apparently, the woman has something very important to say to Strether.", "Chad declares that he'll make sure Strether makes it over to the de Vionnet house.", "He and Jeane walk off together, and now it feels even more like an early-1900s soap opera.", "When Chad doesn't return from his walk with Jeanne, good old Maria Gostrey comes over to Strether saying that Chad has asked her to keep him company.", "Maria is amazed to realize that the de Vionnets have been the women Strether has talked to her about all along .", "Basically, Maria knows Madame de Vionnet from way back, and could have told Strether everything he needed to know about her.", "Miss Gostrey realizes that now that Madame de Vionnet knows she's in town, she'll try to visit.", "But Gostrey plans on avoiding her.", "It's not because she doesn't like Madame de Vionnet.", "It's because she doesn't want to get caught up in Strether's drama.", "She's happy to be a spectator to the whole thing, but doesn't want to be an actor.", "Based on what Maria Gostrey tells Strether, he realizes that Madame de Vionnet can't be a day younger than 38 years old, which makes her at least eight years older than Chad.", "Although Strether is also willing to admit that de Vionnet looks more like 28 than 38.", "He also learns that Madame de Vionnet is actually a Countess, meaning that she's from an old aristocratic French family.", "So he knows that she comes from a privileged background.", "This is when the alarm bells reminding us of the time Maria said maybe Chad's girlfriend was too good for his own fam start ring-a-dinging in our heads.", "Maria announces that she thinks that Madame de Vionnet has molded Chad into a cultured man for the sake of marrying him to her daughter, Jeanne.", "Further, she thinks that de Vionnet is going to try to get Strether's blessing for the marriage, since she knows that Chad respects Strether.", "This makes Strether feel a bit used, but he's still not complaining about having so many women suddenly interested in his opinion.", "Strether says that he's not sure if he wants to go meet Madame de Vionnet alone.", "But Maria insists that he has to, since he would have done the same had he tracked down the \"evil\" woman he expected to find Chad with.", "Maria also mentions that she's confident Madame de Vionnet won't tell Strether anything about her past that she doesn't want him to know.", "It's an odd statement, but Strether will let it slide for now.", "After this meeting, Strether goes to see Chad again, and he asks him outright if he's engaged to Jeanne de Vionnet.", "Chad shakes his head and says nope.", "And that's that.", "But wait, Strether says.", "Then whey can't Chad come back to the States?", "He just won't accept the fact that Chad doesn't want to go back to boring old Woollett.", "Basically, Chad says that he owes everything to Madame de Vionnet for transforming him into such a classy, smart man with sexy grey streaks in his hair.", "He can't bear the thought of leaving her and seeming ungrateful.", "Strether answers this by making Chad a deal: if he goes to see Madame de Vionnet with an open mind, Chad has to have an open mind about coming home.", "Chad says deal, and away we go.", "Strether mentions that he's afraid of Madame de Vionnet in a strange way.", "But Chad says there's nothing to be afraid of, other than liking the woman too much.", "Uh huh.", "Predictably, Strether then admits that he's afraid of this very thing, because he's even more afraid of doing something to anger Chad's mother, Mrs. Newsome.", "Before ending their meeting, Strether feels like he has to ask Chad one last thing--is Madame de Vionnet a virtuous person.", "Or in other words, does she lead a moral life without boozing or sleeping around.", "Chad replies that her life is indeed \"virtuous.\"", "Once again, Strether never asks for confirmation on what this word actually means.", "The uncertainties go on.", "New scene: Chad and Strether are sitting next to each other again, but this time it's in Madame de Vionnet's drawing room.", "Without hesitating, Chad glances at his watch and says, \"Hey, I totally need to be somewhere.\"", "So he gets up and leaves Strether alone in de Vionnet's house.", "Strether is surprised to find that this doesn't really surprise or scare him, in spite of his previous afraid-in-a-strange-way stuff.", "He can sense that he's changing, becoming less anxious and more confident in his social abilities while he's in Paris.", "And he likes the feeling quite a bit.", "The first thing Madame de Vionnet tells Strether is that she doesn't believe that Strether has faith in his mission to bring Chad home, but that she'll agree to talk to him as if he does.", "She doesn't lose points for candor, that's for sure.", "At first, Strether is pretty hostile because it's more or less his duty not to like Madame de Vionnet.", "But she asks if he's willing to pretend that they do get along, and he finally agrees because he promised Chad he'd keep an open mind.", "They spend the next ten minutes talking around one another and saying how charming they find each other.", "But neither one really says anything concrete.", "Finally, Madame de Vionnet makes the first jab and asks Strether if Mrs. Newsome has dumped him.", "Strether automatically responds, \"Not yet,\" which definitely suggests he has some commitment issues.", "She also adds that she thinks Strether might be happier if he just stayed in Paris.", "He dodges the statement and keeps talking around the point.", "He wants to learn something concrete that he can report back to Mrs. Newsome.", "Madame de Vionnet advises him to just tell Mrs. Newsome everything he's seen.", "The trouble is, though, that Strether's looking for something negative to report on and hasn't found it yet.", "He knows Mrs. Newsome will find it suspicious if he only writes back about good things.", "Strether finally admits that he finds de Vionnet's daughter very charming and attractive.", "Again, Madame de Vionnet tells him to say so to Mrs. Newsome, but he repeats that he can't possibly say this in a letter.", "Strether ends the conversation by telling de Vionnet that he'll \"save her\" if he can.", "She doesn't know what he means by this, and neither does he.", "Yup, typical cliffhanger for our buddy James.", "Another ten days have gone by, and Strether is hanging out at Chad's house.", "By now, you have to figure that the Newsomes are wondering whether Strether has fallen off the face of the Earth.", "Chad repeats that he really hopes Strether will get along with Madame de Vionnet and her daughter Jeanne.", "Strether admits that he likes both, and worse yet, that he's said as much in his most recent letter to Mrs. Newsome.", "We smell a scandal.", "Strether remembers meeting Jeanne de Vionnet and how she told him that she's not just some shy little European girl.", "She feels like she's almost American, too, since her mother brought her up in a semi-American fashion.", "Again, Strether doesn't really know what this means.", "The great sculptor Gloriani comes over to Chad's place and remarks on what good taste in art Chad has.", "Not a bad compliment from someone who puts \"great\" in front of his name.", "Meanwhile, Waymarsh has gone off to have a conversation with Madame de Vionnet.", "Which means: time to gossip about them.", "Strether asks Miss Barrace if Madame de Vionnet is charmed by Waymarsh the way Miss Barrace is.", "Unsurprisingly , the answer is no.", "De Vionnet finds Waymarsh a bucket of yawns.", "And Waymarsh doesn't seem to like her all that much, either.", "Strether suddenly comes out and asks Miss Barrace is Madame de Vionnet plans on getting divorced so she can marry Chad.", "Miss Barrace is shocked by the question and asks why Strether would think this.", "After all, she says, any two people can get married.", "It's keeping up a relationship without marrying that's truly remarkable.", "Predictably, agonizingly, and in keeping with the way things generally go in this book, this isn't an answer to Strether's question.", "Sure, it gives him more food for thought, but it doesn't tell us one way or the other if anything is going on between Chad and Madame de Vionnet.", "After some more beating around the bush, Strether decides again that Chad's relationship to both Madame de Vionnet and her daughter Jeanne is totally innocent.", "It's pretty much like he's doing the same math problem over and over again and keeps getting the same answer and is basically okay with it, but wants to do it again anyway.", "They get back to the subject to Waymarsh, and Miss Barrace criticizes him for taking everything in life too seriously.", "Though she also lets it drop that Waymarsh likes to give her presents.", "Not necessarily because he likes her, but because he likes to spend the money.", "Strether tells Miss Barrace that Waymarsh possesses a \"sacred rage\" , meaning that his Christian, puritan personality leads him to approach life with a constant sense of moral outrage and dissatisfaction.", "Yikes.", "Strether finishes the conversation with a comment about how he only seems to live his life for other people.", "Miss Barrace comes out and asks if this is the case, what does he do for Maria Gostrey?", "The answer: he says he has no clue why Maria likes spending time with him.", "Strether is at some swanky joint and Chad, Miss Barrace, and the Vionnets are all in attendance.", "Madame de Vionnet marches right up to him and asks why Maria Gostrey has suddenly left Paris.", "Strether has no clue.", "Madame says she just got a sudden note from Maria saying that Maria has had to go to the south of France to visit a sick friend.", "Which sounds kind of made up.", "De Vionnet is worried that Maria doesn't like her.", "But she doesn't know what Strether does--that Maria doesn't want to get herself in the middle of the whole Chad drama.", "Plus, Madame de Vionnet wants Strether to stop being so cagey around her.", "If he feels like he's buddies with the new-and-improved Chad Newsome, well, that means he better get better with Madame de Vionnet too, since Chad is basically her creation.", "Strether breaks away from the conversation and wanders over to hang with Bilham some more.", "He asks Bilham if he would ever propose marriage to Jeanne de Vionnet.", "Bilham is shocked at the question, since he's just a poor artist and Jeanne is a Countess' daughter.", "Strether says off-handedly that Bilham is good enough for her.", "But the claim lacks conviction.", "Looks like he's just trying to get a rise outta someone... Bilham says that he needs to think of Chad's feelings.", "Strether, sensing a chance for information, tells Bilham that Chad isn't in love with Jeanne.", "Bilham agrees, but says that Chad is Jeanne's best friend and it might still be weird for Bilham to get involved with her.", "Like a bromance before romance sort of thing, but with some of the roles switched.", "They return to the oft-discussed idea that Chad's connection to Madame de Vionnet and her daughter is a totally \"virtuous\" one.", "Strether mentions that up until this moment, he never fully believed it.", "But now he does.", "Bilham agrees that the relationship between Chad and the Vionnets is one of the finest things he's ever seen.", "Don't forget, words like \"fine\" and \"virtuous\" are very vague.", "Bilham adds a comment about how a man usually can't care as much about a relationship as a woman can.", "He seems to be referring to Chad and Madame de Vionnet.", "Bilham says that things would be better if Chad got married.", "But it's tough because he loves Madame de Vionnet.", "Strether hears this and says, \"You mean in a platonic way, right?\"", "and Bilham pretty much says, \"Uh yeah, sure.\"", "Strether concludes the conversation by saying that Chad shouldn't go back to America; he owes too much to Madame de Vionnet to leave her.", "Whoa, about-face!", "Strether goes to an old church to sit by himself and ponder his situation.", "And not just any church.", "Notre Dame.", "Maybe he thinks he'll find a famous hunchback to solve this question of virtue once and for all.", "So here's the pickle: he now thinks that Chad should stay in Paris, even though it's his personal mission as Newsome ambassador to convince that brat to head home.", "While thinking, he notices a woman coming into the church and sitting down in one of the pews with her back to him.", "Eventually, he realizes that it's Madame de Vionnet.", "She suggests that the two of them go for a walk around the church to take it all in.", "He confesses that he recently bought a 70-volume set of books by famous Frenchie Victor Hugo .", "In other news, Strether thinks that he's becoming too loose with his money.", "A half hour later, Strether finds himself sitting down for lunch with Madame de Vionnet.", "Yes, not the way to save money.", "Neither is buying 70 books by Victor Hugo.", "While they're eating, Madame tells Strether that he strikes her as a man who's in trouble.", "He replies that he doesn't think he is--yet.", "How ominous.", "Strether tells her that he now knows what he meant when he first met her and said that he would try to \"save her.\"", "He meant that he would write to Mrs. Newsome about how lovely she was, and this is what he did.", "He's now waiting for a letter back revealing the consequences.", "He also feels that he should thank Madame for all she's done for Chad.", "Madame de Vionnet, though, wants to hear more about Mrs. Newsome.", "Strether says that all she needs to know is that Mrs. Newsome is a very grand lady.", "Did we say cagey?", "Yeah, we meant it.", "Sensing an opportunity to convert Strether, Madame de Vionnet asks him to stay in Paris--as in, forever.", "In other words, Madame thinks that if Strether stays forever, so will Chad.", "And Strether has another little nagging feeling about being used.", "Madame is worried that Chad's family will make him get married and settle down if he ever sets foot back in America.", "Strether can't deny this, so Madame makes a direct request for Strether to be on her side and to keep Chad in Paris.", "After some painful indecision, he agrees, and Madame de Vionnet thanks him profusely.", "Is our Streth a traitor, or is he just picking his loyalties?", "Three days after his conversation with Madame de Vionnet, Strether receives a short little telegram from America.", "And to get a telegram instead of a letter in those days usually meant that a message was urgent.", "At first, he crumples up the telegram and shoves it into his pocket.", "Mysterious!", "Waymarsh walks past where he's sitting and notices a big change come over his face, so Waymarsh decides to just keep walking and to leave Strether with his thoughts.", "Yes, the suspense is building.", "A few minutes later, though, the two of them sit down for dinner.", "But Strether says nothing about it and Waymarsh won't let on that he's been bit by the curious bug.", "So they say nothing to each other and then part ways again.", "Not one of the more eventful meals of the book.", "Later on, Waymarsh finally breaks his silence and asks Strether if he's heard any news.", "Strether says that he hasn't heard anything more than usual.", "Whatever that means.", "The next day, Chad shows up at Strether's room and asks Strether if the word from Woollett has finally come through.", "Strether is surprised at Chad's knowledge of what's going on, and wonders if he got a telegram, too.", "Chad says he hasn't, but just points to Strether's telegram and guesses at what's going on.", "Chad says out of nowhere that he's ready to head back to Woollett with Strether.", "He feels that Strether has felt the full benefit of his time in Paris and that he's looking much fitter and healthier.", "Strether breaks the news to Chad that Mama Newsome is in poor health.", "Chad replies that this is all the more reason for the two of them to leave immediately.", "But here's the thing: Strether now argues that Chad can't go home just yet.", "Chad actually wants to go home and see his mother, especially if she's not doing so great.", "But now it's Strether who says he's not ready to go back to the dull world of Woollett anymore.", "Switcheroo!", "Strether also mentions that Mrs. Newsome has given him an ultimatum.", "Either he bring Chad home immediately, or comes home himself.", "Either way, there'll be no more delaying.", "Which is pretty much the exact opposite of what he's doing.", "Strether asks Chad why he would make him enjoy Paris and Madame de Vionnet so much if his plan was to go home all along.", "Chad answer that he thought it would do Strether good, which it definitely has.", "Strether tells Chad about Mrs. Newsome's plan to marry him off to Mamie Pocock once he's back in America.", "He's really looking for outs now.", "Chad realizes that what's really going on is that Strether doesn't want to go back to Mrs. Newsome, but he doesn't have the guts to break it off, either.", "Chad says that Mrs. Newsome will send her daughter Sarah if he and Strether try to buy more time.", "Strether is okay with letting this happen, since it'll do exactly that: buy him some more time in Paris.", "He also has a distant hope that Sarah will have the same experience as him and be so impressed with Chad that she'll want him to stay in Paris.", "Chad proposes going back to America himself and leaving Strether in Paris.", "But Strether is too chicken for this, too.", "It's like he can't make excuses to himself to stay in Paris without Chad there.", "Chad promises to stand by Strether's side in Paris.", "Which is pretty ironic considering they just flipped the whole premise of the book.", "They seal their deal with a little handshake and part ways.", "Strether visits Maria Gostrey and says that he's pretty certain that Waymarsh has been communicating with the Newsomes behind his back and telling them about how he's living it up in Paris.", "He also finally reveals what was in Mrs. Newsome's telegram, which was the message, \"Take the first ship back to America.\"", "Maria is disappointed at the news, since she figures Strether will of course go back home.", "He says he should go back home after she abandoned him the way she did, going away from Paris with barely any warning.", "Which is kind of forward considering their former dance of coyness, if you ask us.", "Maria, though, insists that her absence has helped Strether become more independent.", "At first, he was totally reliant on her.", "But now he doesn't need to rely on her or any woman for guidance.", "He can just be his own person.", "If that's what he gets from being her \"client,\" it's a way more \"virtuous\" deal than we gave her credit for.", "He tells Maria that he's not going to leave, at least not yet.", "Maria asks him if he's going to confront Waymarsh about possibly sending secret telegrams and generally being a rat.", "But Strether says he probably won't because Waymarsh has actually done him a favor by forcing the Newsomes to act.", "He also tells Maria about his new plan to keep Chad in Paris.", "He already knows Mrs. Newsome's next move: she'll send her daughter, the intimidating Sarah Pocock , to come and get Chad and bring him home.", "Strether knows that Sarah is much more of a hard-nosed Newsome than he is, and she probably won't give in to the charms of Paris.", "He also says he plans on playing along with the whole game and taking Sarah to see Madame de Vionnet.", "He's not going to let on in the least that the Newsomes are mad, and he's just gong to act as though everything is fantastic.", "Yes, playing dumb, a brilliant scheme.", "He wraps up the conversation by saying that for once in his life, he's glad to be living.", "Two days later, Chad gets a return telegram from Woollett saying that Sarah and her husband Jim Pocock are coming to Paris immediately.", "And not only that, they're bringing Mamie with them.", "Strether's own telegram to Mrs. Newsome has said that he thinks it best to stay in Paris another month, but that he's glad to welcome Sarah and the rest of the \"re-enforcements\" .", "He notices during this time that Mrs. Newsome's letters are becoming more and more infrequent, suggesting that the bond between them is breaking.", "If you hear a chorus of tiny violins at the tragedy...you're probably alone.", "Returning to his conversation with Maria, Strether says that he's felt younger ever since he first met her.", "He says that no matter what else fails him in life, he's certain that Maria never will.", "Yep, that Newsome bond is broke.", "The chapter ends with Strether waiting for the Pococks to arrive in Paris.", "He's not sure what to expect, but at least he'll get a better idea of where he stands with them.", "Right?", "Strether keeps rambling along and killing time.", "During this period, he keeps up a fairly chilly relationship with Waymarsh, which seems to suit Waymarsh just fine.", "He gives Waymarsh several opportunities to confess to writing to the Newsomes, but the dude never admits to anything.", "For Strether, this period also gives him the most independence he's felt since arriving in Paris, since he's pretty much free of Waymarsh.", "On a random walk one day, Strether stops in at Madame de Vionnet's house and asks if the lady is at home.", "The doorman replies that Madame is out of the city, and Strether walks away disappointed.", "At this moment, he's struck with a sudden fear of Sarah Pocock and dreads her arrival in Paris.", "He knows that he's easily influenced, and he's scared that Sarah will suck away all his newfound enjoyment of life.", "After all, if he could get turned on to the European life so easily, it makes sense that he could just as easily be turned off of it.", "And all in a flash, he finds himself standing on the platform at the train station.", "He welcomes Sarah, her husband Jim, and Mamie Pocock as they arrive.", "Waymarsh has accompanied him.", "At this moment, Strether realizes that Sarah and Waymarsh will probably get along very well, since they're both total sticks-in-the-mud .", "Strether makes a few comments to Chad about his mother sending her daughter like a piece in a chess game.", "But then he feels ashamed because lately, it must sound like he's constantly taking jabs at Chad's mom.", "Chad doesn't think this is the case though, which makes Strether feel better.", "Strether explains to Chad that the reason the Pococks have come is because he has spoken very highly of Paris and Madame de Vionnet when he obviously wasn't supposed to.", "The two of them ponder a bit about whether de Vionnet will be able to make Sarah Pocock like her.", "They both decide that it's impossible to tell until the women actually meet.", "Good conclusion.", "They finish the chapter by wondering to each other whether Mrs. Newsome has even mentioned Madame de Vionnet to Sarah.", "One can never know when it comes to Mrs. Newsome's strategy.", "She always seems to be a few steps ahead.", ".", "Strether and Chad decide that when they head back to the hotel, Chad will get in a cab with Sarah and Mamie, and Strether will get in a cab with Jim Pocock .", "Once they're in the cabs, Jim starts thanking Strether for giving him the excuse to come to Paris with Sarah.", "Jim is all wide-eyed and drinking in all of the interesting sights around him.", "He's not ignorant of the fact that Woollett is a boring little town, and he's glad to be out of it for a few days.", "At least someone gets it.", "Strether has another moment where he hopes both Sarah and Jim will tug at his sleeve at some point and whisper to him, \"Wow, you're totally right.", "Chad is way cooler now.\"", "But throughout their cab ride, Jim Pocock never says a word about Chad.", "Strether begins to get concerned.", "He can't believe that anyone could be so ignorant to not notice what a great gentleman Chad has become.", "But it seems like the effect has been totally lost on the likes of Jim Pocock.", "Strether starts to resent the dude for being so blind to true classiness.", "Worse yet, Jim's silence begins to make Strether second-guess his own opinion of Chad.", "And just as he's thinking about Jim, Strether realizes what his main problem is with Woollett and the people from there: \"the society over there was essentially a society of women, and that poor Jim wasn't a part of it\" .", "And here, Strether hits on what's been making him so annoyed with Mrs. Newsome.", "It's the fact that she totally has authority in their relationship, and that this makes Strether feel like less of a man.", "Bummer.", "Jim suddenly exclaims out loud that if he were Chad, there's no way he would ever come back to Woollett.", "Jim wishes he could come to Paris and live there immediately.", "Touche.", "Strether admits that it's also important for Chad to go home and run the family business, though this is just lip service that he hopes Jim will repeat back to Sarah so he doesn't get in too much trouble.", "But then, Strether admits to Jim that he has enjoyed Paris a little too much.", "And at this point, Jim realizes that Strether has intentionally been prolonging his vacation.", "He loves it, though, because he wishes he had the same opportunity to get away from his wife and mother-in-law.", "Strether mentions that Sarah seems to be in good humor.", "Jim says that Strether knows better than to think he can read Sarah's moods.", "Sarah is a master manipulator, and there's no way you can ever know what she's actually thinking.", "This family gets better all the time.", "Jim concludes a little speech about the Newsome women by saying that they always find ways to get what they want without ever raising their voices.", "Whoa.", "Jim finishes their conversation by telling Strether not to go home, because Mrs. Newsome will totally control him.", "Sounds like someone could use some marriage counseling!", "When Strether goes to visit Sarah Pocock the next day, he finds that Madame de Vionnet has already come to see her, and the two of them are alone together.", "But as he glances toward the window, he realizes that the two women haven't been alone.", "Waymarsh is in the room with them.", "He walks in just as Madame de Vionnet is making an offer to show Sarah around Paris.", "Sarah says that she already knows Paris, in a very I-don't-need-your-help kind of way.", "There's already some friction there, for sure.", "Madame de Vionnet follows up with the claim that it's always good for women to help each other out.", "It's pretty clear she's not just talking about giving a tour of Paris.", "By this point in the book these little double entendres are flying around all.", "The.", "Time.", "De Vionnet also picks up on Sarah's claim to already know Paris, and says that the Newsomes must have some sort of natural love for Paris, since Chad has fit in so well.", "Yeah, probably not what Sarah wants to hear.", "De Vionnet then points to Strether and says that he, even more than Chad, fell in love with Paris instantly.", "She praises him for his ability to just let himself go and live life.", "Of course, this is the total opposite of what a prude like Sarah wants to hear, so she basically gives Strether an icy stare after Madame says this.", "Strether feels like he needs to step in here and tell Madame de Vionnet that he hasn't let himself go all that much.", "He's lying of course, but dude needs to look like he has some sort of distance from Madame and her people.", "He wraps up by saying that he came to Paris to do a job and that he's done it.", "That's more what Sarah wants to hear.", "Waymarsh has to butt in with a comment about how Strether has let himself go, and not necessarily for the better.", "Madame brushes him off.", "You could cut the tension with a hairpin from the ninetheenth century.", "They end the meeting with Madame de Vionnet offering to have Sarah over to her place to meet her daughter, Jeanne.", "Sarah accepts the invitation, since she'll want to report back to her mother about the details of Madame's life.", "This is all starting to sound like stuff out of a spy movie.", "At this point, Madame de Vionnet tells Sarah about what a big role Maria Gostrey has played in Strether's life since he arrived in Europe.", "The two of them are practically inseparable.", "Strether, secretly pissed at Madame for spilling all his dirt, loosens his collar and gives a nice little \"heh heh\" before telling Sarah that Mrs. Newsome probably mentioned Maria Gostrey to her, since Strether has told Mrs. Newsome all about her.", "Meanwhile, Sarah's all like, \"I've never heard about this person, but nice try at acting innocent, Strether.\"", "Madame de Vionnet won't stop going on about how close Strether and Maria are, and Strether is thinking to himself, \"Please stop talking,\" but de Vionnet just keeps going.", "Waymarsh butts in again and says, flat out, that Maria Gostrey loves Strether.", "Madame de Vionnet instantly defuses this comment, though, by saying that everyone loves Strether.", "Yeah, this book is basically the 1903 version of Everybody Loves Raymond.", "Finally, Strether joins in on the conversation in a joking tone and says, \"Oh yes.", "No one can be friends with Maria Gostrey but me.", "I keep her to myself.", "Heh heh.\"", "Which is meant to be an attempt at sarcasm to deflate the problem.", "Nice try.", "This doesn't make things any better , because Madame immediately follows it up by telling Sarah that Maria is very good-looking.", "Sheesh, it's like she's trying to ruin Strether's relationship with Mrs. Newsome or something...", "Right in front of Sarah and Waymarsh, Strether and Madame de Vionnet then make plans to have their own private meeting the next day.", "It's really weird, and even kind of rude.", "Kind of like they're trying to scare off the Newsomes on purpose?", "Madame de Vionnet starts talking up how beautiful her daughter Jeanne is, then asks Sarah to bring Mamie Pocock--the pride of Woollett--with her the next time they meet.", "It's a not-so-subtle-way of saying, \"We'll see who's produced a more beautiful girl, Woollett or Paris.\"", "Strether feels compelled to say that Jeanne de Vionnet is basically a perfect woman.", "And Sarah stares daggers at him for it.", "Really, he's kind of asking for it.", "The meeting ends, and Strether walks down with Madame to Vionnet to her waiting carriage.", "It looks like she has just crushed Sarah at verbal boxing.", "What Strether's been crushed by, we'll have to wait and see.", "Strether is alone with Madame de Vionnet.", "He tells her that the main problem they're facing is that Sarah will refuse to acknowledge the improvements Chad has made over the past few years.", "It's like she's playing a fixed game, because any change that Chad can make while he's away from the virtuous Newsomes is automatically a bad one.", "Or in other words, the Newsomes look at the world with a sort of prejudice that Chad no longer possesses, and Strether is happy for the improvement.", "He admits that he's scared of Sarah Pocock and that it's difficult for him to defy her.", "Madame asks why, and he says it's because he's an anxious person and Sarah totally knows how to manipulate his anxiety.", "Even in their last meeting, for example, Sarah intentionally left out certain information about Mrs. Newsome's current thoughts about the engagement--which he sees as totally designed to make him paranoid.", "They wonder to each other about whether Sarah will be able to convince Chad to come home.", "Strether mentions that Chad has actually been spending most of his time with Jim, and that Jim is probably telling Chad not to come home behind Sarah's back.", "And it's not just because Jim loves Paris himself.", "It's because Jim is the dude who will probably runs the Newsomes' business is Chad doesn't come home.", "The plot thickens...", "While Chad and Jim are hanging out in Paris, Sarah is going to hang out with Waymarsh.", "Sounds like a yawn-fest to us.", "True to form, Strether thinks this'll be a great experience for both of them, because they're more alike than any other two characters in the book.", "They'll totally get along because both of them are cranks.", "Strether also suggests that Paris might actually still seduce Sarah the way it seduced him.", "We don't know why he still thinks this.", "Madame reminds him, though, that he had Maria Gostrey when he first arrived.", "Who is going to do the seducing to Sarah?", "Strether hopes that the new-and-improved Chad will be good enough, though he's a smidgeon less confident now.", "Their meeting ends, and Madame decides to walk a little way with Strether before they actually leave one another.", "Strether tells Madame that he wishes Mrs. Newsome herself could come to Paris and see Madame's beautiful house.", "It might not make a difference, but part of him still wishes Mrs. Newsome would see it, if only to show her that a whole world exists beyond her tiny town.", "The absolutely LAST thing Madame says to Strether in this meeting is that her daughter Jeanne is going to get married.", "This is a total shock and totally unrelated to what they've been talking about, but she wanted to let him know.", "It's more or less a marriage that Madame and her estranged husband have made for Jeanne.", "Strether asks whether Jeanne has had any say in the matter, and Madame assures him that Jeanne is happy to marry whomever her mother approves of.", "This is weird to Strether, who's more used to American ideas of love and marriage.", "But hey, to each their own.", "Strether wonders how Chad feels about the marriage, but decides he won't ask him right away.", "Just in case you needed another dose of suspense.", "It's been a week since Sarah Pocock's arrival and she hasn't so much as spoken to Strether since their first meeting.", "Strether realizes that this is some sort of head game to make him feel anxious.", "But he refuses to give in to it, so he heads out to visit Maria Gostrey.", "That lady has always been really good at calming him down.", "Maria wants to know what all the gang's plans are, so it's update time.", "Strether mentions that Waymarsh is taking Sarah Pocock to dinner, and Sarah's husband Jim is going to explore Paris on his own.", "Okay, so that's kind of weird.", "But what's even weirder is that after dinner, Sarah and Waymarsh are going to go see the circus.", "Yes, the two people in the book who least like fun.", "Unless they're just going to throw stones at clowns.", "Anyway, they've tried to keep their circus trip a secret, which makes the whole thing even stranger.", "But Strether's found out and he loves to know how phony these people are for pretending that they don't like fun things.", "He also mentions that Chad will have dinner alone with Mamie Pocock at his own apartment that night.", "Intriguing.", "Strether doesn't think anything will happen between them, though.", "Strether revels in the idea that Sarah has fallen in love with Waymarsh, since these two dullards really seem to deserve each other.", "Maria asks if Waymarsh is in love with Sarah, but Strether doesn't think so.", "But he also knows Waymarsh well enough to know that his ego would love to have this younger, married woman in love with him.", "That's why he's taking her to dinner--to stoke his pride.", "Maria suddenly asks him if he's heard about Jeanne de Vionnet's engagement.", "He has, which makes Maria sad that she doesn't have any new gossip to tell him.", "Strether now muses about how Chad might wish that he were more in love with Jeanne.", "It's pretty obvious that Madame de Vionnet would have blessed his marriage with her, so it'd be nice and convenient if he were in love with her.", "Yes, it's pretty weird as far as hypothetical alternate universes go.", "But at the same time, Strether knows it's sad that Chad's true affection seems to be with Madame de Vionnet herself, although he could never hope to marry her without some catastrophe happening first .", "Strether also mentions that Jim Pocock seems like he's on their side, in terms of keeping Chad in Paris.", "What's even better, though, is that no one in the Newsome family seems to realize how much Jim wants to escape their clutches.", "No one, that is, except his sister Mamie.", "Up to this point, we've been told that Mamie is just nice to look at.", "But Strether is now suggesting that there's more to Mamie than meets the eye.", "Strether heads back to Sarah Pocock's place.", "He knows that she's been expecting him, but she isn't in her hotel room.", "Maybe the circus went late?", "Nah, he's pretty certain that this is some sort of power play to make him wait and to let his anxious thoughts totally eat him alive.", "He bumbles around her room until he realizes that both doors leading out to the balcony are open, and that there's a lady standing out there and staring down at the street.", "He assumes it's Sarah, but is then surprised to see that it's Mamie Pocock.", "Finally, he clears his throat to let her know that he's there.", "She turns around suddenly and says that she thought he was Mr. Bilham.", "Wait, thinks Strether.", "How does Mamie know Chad's artist friend Bilham?", "And furthermore, why was she staring down into the street so, dare we say, longingly while she was waiting for him?", "They start off by discussing Mamie's recent meeting with Jeanne de Vionnet.", "Mamie admits that Jeanne is perfect--so perfect, in fact, that no man should ever touch her.", "Um, okay.", "So then Strether has to let her know that Jeanne has just gotten engaged.", "Mamie says she already knows this because Jeanne's new fiance, Monsieur de Montbron , was at the de Vionnet house when Mamie visited.", "She says the dude is totally in love with Jeanne, though Jeanne doesn't seem to be so sure.", "Oh well, they'll get married one way or the other.", "At this moment, Strether has the mean thought that by the time Mamie reaches thirty, she'll be too fat to be pretty.", "Ouch.", "Mamie keeps talking about Jeanne, saying that the girl's main problem is that she's too desperate to please the people around her.", "Strether can relate to this.", "Strether takes his leave of Mamie and shakes her hand, leaving her to wait for the arrival of Bilham.", "Three nights after his meeting with Mamie, Strether hangs out with the artist Bilham at Madame de Vionnet's place.", "They're at another one of her swanky parties.", "Strether is feeling ashamed of himself again.", "He's in one of his depressed modes where hanging with Bilham makes him realize how much wiser Bilham is than Strether was at his age.", "And again, Strether despairs at having wasted his youth.", "Strether dives into conversation with Bilham by asking what the young man thinks of Sarah Pocock.", "More specifically, Strether wants to know what Bilham thinks Sarah's attitude toward Chad is.", "Bilham insists that Sarah Pocock envies the changes that have happened in Chad.", "Which is news to Strether, who thought she was pretty anti-everything.", "The only thing is that she wants Chad to bring his new-and-improved self back to Woollett so they can enjoy him back there instead of in Paris.", "It's because Chad's so improved that Sarah will not rest until he's home.", "According to Bilham, Sarah can't bear the idea that Chad's charm would be wasted on people like them.", "Bilham adds that he's not saying the people in Woollett aren't great.", "In fact, they're every bit as good as the people in Paris .", "It's just that Woollett doesn't have the rich cultural history and heritage that makes Paris so fab.", "Strether adds that he thinks Chad's situation would be a lot better if the guy got married.", "Bilham asks if he's talking about Mamie Pocock, but Strether says he's actually talking about Madame de Vionnet--you know, if her husband dies.", "Strether says he also thinks it's his duty to find Bilham a wife, too.", "This totally floors the young artist, who has no clue who Strether might have in mind.", "Besides, Strether suggested earlier in the book that Bilham should marry Jeanne, which was a total pipe dream.", "Strether admits that Jeanne was a crazy idea.", "But now he thinks Bilham should marry Mamie Pocock.", "Bilham wants to know where he got this idea, and Strether said he knows Mamie was waiting for him longingly on her balcony the other day which makes it pretty clear that she's in love with him.", "What a gossip.", "Bilham asks whether Mamie might be in love with Chad, but Strether assures that Mamie, in fact, probably hates Chad.", "Mamie wanted to be the girl to \"save\" him for the dirtiness of Paris; but now that she has seen how awesome he is, she realizes that she's too late.", "Another woman has already saved him, so she's pretty much been kicked to the curb.", "Bilham gets up to circulate around the party, and just as he leaves, Miss Barrace comes over and sits down in Bilham's place.", "They joke a little bit about Maria Gostrey not being at the party because she's waiting up for Strether back at home...Yeah, it's kinda shocking as far as 1903 jokes go.", "Strether gloats a little bit about the fact that Sarah Pocock is at the party, too, and that there's absolutely nothing that she could object to.", "In Strether's words, Sarah is bricked up and buried alive.", "She's trapped on the chessboard with no more moves left to make.", "Miss Barrace reminds him that Sarah still has enough room to breathe, and this might be all she needs.", "Barrace, for example, has met Sarah and has been received coldly.", "So the battle doesn't seem to be over just yet.", "It's just using weirder metaphors.", "Miss Barrace tells Strether that she feels like everyone at the party is in the middle of an epic drama and that Strether is the hero of the story.", "Wow, it's almost as if she's read a book called The Ambassadors by Henry James.", "Strether admits the he might be too much of a scaredy cat to be the hero.", "Miss Barrace finally comes out and says, \"No matter what, don't let Chad go back to America.\"", "After all, it's his duty as a hero.", "The two of them reflect of Sarah being at the party, and Miss Barrace comments on how Jim Pocock has already decided to fight on the side of the Paris crowd.", "Basically, he's like a spy that Madame de Vionnet has been able to turn to her side.", "But you can only imagine how furious Sarah Pocock must be if she knows this.", "The drama continues.", "One morning later in the week, Strether is eating breakfast with Waymarsh when he suddenly suspects that something big is about to happen.", "He can just feel it from the way Waymarsh butters his roll.", "Waymarsh comes out and says he's been speaking with Sarah, and that she'll come by the hotel in an hour to talk to Strether about something important.", "Waymarsh also drops a weird comment about how Sarah is coming over for Strether's own good.", "He wasn't wrong about that roll.", "Strether then asks if Sarah has any some sort of unexpected news from home, which Waymarsh responds to by saying that they are leaving Paris.", "Who, pray tell, does he mean by \"they\"?", "Well, of course the group will include Sarah, her husband Jim, and Mamie.", "But here's a funny thing: Waymarsh is going to go with them.", "Now it's clear that Waymarsh is on the Newsomes' side, and that he might also have something going on with Sarah.", "Plus, they're all going to go to Switzerland before heading back to America.", "Strether asks Waymarsh if it's Sarah's mission to bring him along, too, but Waymarsh is totally tightlipped.", "Strether tells Waymarsh that he hopes he enjoys his time in Switzerland.", "After all, the two of them are very old and they need to enjoy things while they can.", "Waymarsh doesn't like this comment at all, but his usual comebacks don't have the power they once did.", "Must have lost his knack at the circus.", "The time has come for Strether to sit down and finally have it out with Sarah Pocock.", "The cards are on the table, the gloves are off...you see where things are headed here.", "Strether gets down to brass tacks and asks Sarah if Chad blames their failure to return to America all on him.", "Sarah, in turn, answers by asking Strether if he plans on blaming it all on Chad.", "Direct hit number one.", "Or so she thinks.", "Strether takes a deep breath, braces himself, and says that no matter what's been said, he'll take full responsibility for his and Chad's non-return.", "And he would like to see Chad again before his next meeting with Sarah.", "Sarah, though, says she's got no plans to meet Strether at all before she leaves.", "In other words, this might be a breakup conversation she's having on her mom's behalf.", "Strether then asks Sarah if her instructions from Mrs. Newsome are to break his will and drag him home.", "But as always, Sarah won't say anything about Mrs. Newsome at all.", "This is like a shadowy presence in this book, sending representatives but never revealing her own thoughts.", "Sarah tells Strether that the way he's been acting is nothing short of an outrage.", "He has totally blown off his duty to the Newsome family.", "Strether says that Sarah needs to acknowledge Chad's improvement under the influence of Madame de Vionnet, but Sarah counters that Chad's only devotion should be to his family.", "It's disgusting that he would choose another family over his own flesh and blood.", "Yep, she said disgusting.", "And here comes the boom.", "Sarah says that Madame de Vionnet is a shameful woman, not even an \"apology for a decent woman\" .", "Burn!", "At this point, Strether realizes that there is nothing in the world that will ever convince the Pococks that they're not better than everyone else.", "Sarah doesn't have any evidence to back up her claim about Madame de Vionnet, but that ain't gonna stop her.", "She goes on to tell Strether that he's mad if he thinks any woman in the world could ever hold a candle to her mother.", "Which is just delusional, if you ask us.", "Strether comes out and accuses Sarah of being a prejudiced, ignorant woman.", "He can't believe that after all she's seen, she can still be some pig-headed about her family's superiority.", "Doesn't she see that the Newsomes are just big fish in a small pond back in Woollett?", "Sarah says that Chad's changes are \"hideous\" .", "Strether concludes by saying that if Sarah truly thinks this, then they're at a total impasse and all they can do is part ways.", "Sarah agrees and gets up to leave.", "At this point, Strether knows that his relationship with the whole Newsome family is now probably at an end.", "Big loss.", "The evening after meeting with Sarah, Strether heads back to Madame de Vionnet's place.", "He's been looking for Chad, but can't find him, so he heads to Chad's apartment and lets himself in.", ".", "Standing on Chad's balcony, he looks out over the city and thinks about the first day he arrived in Paris.", "Lots has changed since then.", "In case you hadn't noticed.", "Finally, in the middle of the night, Chad gets back home.", "Strether confronts him about how he sold Strether out and told Sarah that staying in Paris was all Strether's idea.", "They were supposed to be in on this together.", "Chad says he didn't say anything of the sort: Strether must have been tricked!", "Strether tells Chad that Sarah is afraid of him .", "She's been exposed to a world outside Woollett and she wants to retreat from it immediately, to go back to her small town where she and her family are big shots.", "Basically, she's insecure and wants to feel powerful again.", "The two of them come to the conclusion that the Newsomes will never be able to leave Chad to be happy in Paris.", "They're kind of like the old person living in the apartment beneath yours who's always hitting the ceiling with a broom to tell you to keep it down.", "Quite frankly, the Newsomes hate fun, and they hate it even more when other people are having fun.", "Kind of like Waymarsh.", "Strether also informs Chad that the Pococks' trip to Paris hasn't been to report back on Chad, but to report back on Strether himself.", "Chad asks if this means that things are broken off between Strether and Mrs. Newsome, and the only answer Strether can give is, well, probably.", "In a tactful way, Chad asks if Strether will be able to survive financially without Mrs. Newsome's help.", "Strether again says, probably.", "Strether counters with the question of whether Chad is prepared to give up the fortune he'll inherit in order to stay in Paris.", "Chad says he doesn't really care about money.", "Strether says he needs to meet with Sarah Pocock one last time before she leaves.", "Chad says he can't imagine what good this will do , but Strether tells Chad that he just doesn't get it because he has no imagination.", "Chad admits that this is true, but it's okay because he's still charming and handsome.", "He also tells Strether that he might suffer from too much imagination.", "After all, isn't that what paranoia is?", "Think about it.", "Strether sits down with Maria Gostrey and tells her that Sarah and her crew are leaving Paris.", "Good riddance.", "He also mentions that the artist Bilham is going with them so he can be with Mamie, which we all pretty much saw coming.", "Jim Pocock is the only one among them who doesn't seem to have a partner, since his wife Sarah and Waymarsh are spending all their time together.", "But Strether says that Jim's the type who will appreciate the break from his wife.", "We also find out that Jim has been paying visits to Madame de Vionnet on his own, which Sarah would kill him for if she ever found out.", "Strether wishes--kind of spitefully--that Madame de Vionnet would go to Switzerland as Jim's date, just to show Sarah that she can't run away from the hard truth that the Newsomes aren't so great.", "That's harsh, man.", "Maria asks Strether what the odds are of him ever leaving Paris, and he says he's not sure.", "Finally , Maria comes out and says she wants Strether to stay in Paris... for her.", "Strether, though, can only answer this by asking Maria why she disappeared for two months when he first came to Paris, especially if she cares about him so much.", "She answers that it was good for him and that he never would have learned to stick up for himself.", "He's always relied on a woman to tell him what to do, and now he's his own man.", "Strether admits that he missed Maria badly while she was gone.", "He also tells her that things between him and Mrs. Newsome are pretty much kaput.", "Maria asks Strether what he wants to get out of the whole situation, and Strether can only answer that what he wants is something he can't even begin to understand.", "It's just too big a question.", "Which is super vague and philosophical and shows that this book is not ready to wrap up anytime soon.", "Strether tells Maria that he has had his final meeting with Sarah Pocock, and instead of breaking things off with her, he has asked her for another delay.", "He'd like to make his final decision in another month.", "Which seems silly because isn't he done with them already?", "But on the other hand it's because he wants things back on his terms.", "Anyway, we're not quite sure how Sarah reacted to this.", "Strether feels sad for Sarah Pocock .", "He feels that he has gone out of his way to meet her halfway on a lot of things, but she hasn't been willing to give an inch because of her prejudices.", "This is basically because it was always an ultimatum with her: either Mrs. Newsome is the greatest thing since GOD, or Strether can find himself another fiancee.", "The younger, more spineless Strether would have totally caved at this demand, but the new Strether sure as heck won't.", "Maria warns him that he might still break and go running back.", "It's obvious she doesn't want to see this happen, but she's not sure if Strether has been totally tested yet.", "Maria closes the conversation by saying that Chad and Madame de Vionnet have both left town, probably to get away from Strether for a while.", "Strether isn't particularly hurt by this, but it's enough to make you wonder if everything is going to work out with his new-found besties if he chooses Paris over Woollett.", "A few days after his meeting with Maria Gostrey, Strether takes a train a few miles out of Paris to roam the countryside and be as free as a bird.", "Everything is totally hunky-dory.", "He suddenly has a ton of vivid memories about living in America and how lame it was by comparison.", "Right now, he's looking out over beautiful meadows.", "Back then, he was looking at cardboard factories.", "Yep, sounds pretty dull.", "He eventually ends up at a nice little country inn and orders himself some dinner.", "While the dinner is getting ready, he takes a walk down to a river and looks out at a couple riding along in a boat.", "But something is wrong.", "Something in the boat grabs his attention.", "And you know what that means.", "Cliffhanger!", "Now it's time for the big revelation: the two people in the boat are none other than Chad Newsome and Madame de Vionnet.", "Come on, don't act like you're that surprised.", "Plus, it's not like the two of them are just enjoying a day in the country.", "Strether can tell from the shock in Madame de Vionnet's eyes that he has caught these two doing something that doesn't quite fit into his moral code.", "And so at this moment, all of reality seems to come crashing down on Strether.", "He realizes that Chad and Madame have left Paris so they can find a nice quiet inn outside the city and, ahem, engage in a sexual relationship.", "Of course, Strether tries to act cool about it once he sees that Madame de Vionnet has recognized him.", "He waves from the shore and invites them to dinner.", "You know, because to walk away would be awkward.", "Once Chad and Madame get to shore, all of them are like, \"Wow, what a coincidence!", "It's great to see you.\"", "While they're all thinking, \"God, Strether totally knows about what's been going on this whole time.\"", "This is followed by a super awkward dinner, where Chad and Madame can only think about how ol' third-wheel Strether is blowing their chance at sex.", "While Strether is thinking that his whole life has been a lie since getting to Paris.", "He's not the cool guy he thought he was.", "Instead, he's the one gullible loser in Paris who was too naive to see what was happening right in front of his eyes.", "Things are about to get real.", "When Strether leaves them and goes home, he realizes that all along, he's been allowing himself to enjoy Paris because he has enjoyed being among young women and men while still thinking to himself that he wasn't doing anything morally wrong.", "Which was a nice illusion, while it lasted.", "But now his image of a perfect Chad and perfect Madame de Vionnet has been shattered, and he

resolves to woo her in secret.", "He suddenly recalls that Hortensio and Gremio mentioned procuring a schoolmaster, and he decides to disguise himself as a teacher in the hope that by tutoring Bianca he will be able to declare his love for her and win her heart.", "Tranio, for his part, will pretend to be Lucentio and study at the university.", "Biondello, Lucentio's other servant, arrives in a

have a hard time restraining their anger, for now there will be three competing suitors for Bianca.", "Lucentio, of course, has arranged for Tranio to make this entrance in order to distract Hortensio and Gremio and give him more time for his own wooing.", "Tranio persuades the suitors that they can all be friends while they compete for Bianca, and he wins their good graces by offering to buy them a drink.", "The whole company considers this an excellent suggestion, and they all depart together.", "Chaos rules at Baptista's house the next morning as Katherine chases Bianca, cursing at her in a

deception.", "Petruchio starts off, bluntly as always, by asking Baptista for the opportunity to see Katherine.", "In exchange, he offers a music instructor for her, the disguised Hortensio, whom he

Bianca, while Petruchio presses Baptista further for information about Katherine.", "After confirming that a substantial dowry will accompany his successful wooing of Katherine, Petruchio assures Baptista of his abilities.", "Hortensio cuts him off by returning, his head now bleeding--apparently, when Hortensio attempted to teach Katherine how to play the lute, she promptly took the instrument and smashed it over his head.", "Undaunted, Petruchio waits for Baptista to send Katherine out to see him.", "He decides to adopt the tactic of calling her \"Kate\" and good-naturedly contradicting everything she says.", "Abrasive as always, Katherine tears into Petruchio from the moment he sets foot in her room.", "Petruchio's quick wit, though, proves equal to hers, and Katherine, used to skewering the slower-witted men by whom she is surrounded, finds his aptitude for sparring highly frustrating.", "They engage in a lengthy verbal duel with elaborate puns, each one constructing a new metaphor from the other's comments--Kate's puns generally insult or threaten, but Petruchio twists them into sexual innuendo.", "Eventually, she becomes so enraged that she hits him, but he continues the game just the same, saying that he will marry her whether or not she is willing: \"will you, nill you, I will marry you\" .", "When Baptista, Gremio, and Tranio enter to check on Petruchio's progress, he claims that they have already agreed upon Sunday as the wedding day.", "Kate, shocked, contradicts him, but he ignores her objections and insists to the other men that Katherine cannot keep her hands off him.", "Strangely, Kate remains silent after this remark, and when Petruchio again claims that they will marry on Sunday, she says nothing, and they both leave.", "After recovering from the shock of the hasty arrangement they have just witnessed, Gremio and Tranio immediately move to the matter of Bianca, who suddenly will be available after Sunday.", "Baptista says that

day before Katherine is scheduled to wed Petruchio.", "Lucentio and Hortensio, in their respective disguises as Cambio and Litio, are \"instructing\" Bianca somewhere in Baptista's house, and the scene begins with the two of them battling for her exclusive attention.", "Bianca clearly has begun to form a preference, and she ends the dispute by declaring that she will hear her Latin lesson from Lucentio first, while Hortensio tunes his instrument.", "During the Latin lesson, with Hortensio out of hearing range, Lucentio conveys his true intentions to Bianca through a mock translation of a Latin paragraph.", "She replies to him, in the same way, that she distrusts him, and yet she does not hide the fact that she is taken with her young suitor.", "Hortensio tries to break in at intervals, but Bianca sends him off to tune again until she has finished her conversation with Lucentio.", "Lucentio concludes and Hortensio returns to try his own hand at wooing Bianca.", "He gives her a sheet with a \"gamut,\" or scale, of notes on it, with romantic words cleverly inserted to indicate his true intention.", "Hortensio's words take a different tone, though.", "While Lucentio was confident and coy, Hortensio pleads almost pitifully: \"show pity, or I die\" .", "Bianca resists his attempt more directly, failing to give the playful glimmer of hope she afforded Lucentio.",

from Bianca.", "He sees clearly that Lucentio is infatuated with Bianca.", "But he does not yet know what her intentions are, and he suspects that his own chances might be slim.", "Preparing for the

gathered for the wedding of Kate and Petruchio.", "The groom, however, is late, and Baptista has begun to worry.", "Kate frets that Petruchio habitually woos women only to leave them standing at the

them, and a few arrive just as Petruchio and Kate return.", "Petruchio immediately becomes enraged, claiming that his servants fail to attend him properly.", "They do their best, but clearly he is not pleased by anything.", "He demands dinner, and they prepare it as quickly as possible, but he claims that the meat is burned and pushes the whole meal off the table.", "In the meantime, Kate, visibly tired and hungry, pleads with him to be more patient with the servants.", "Petruchio cheerfully tells her that he demands much of them for her benefit--his new bride will receive nothing short of perfection, he says, pretending to ignore the fact that his new bride simply needs a hot meal.", "After taking her off to bed without food, Petruchio returns to the stage alone and announces his intentions.", "All his actions have been calculated to aggravate Kate and to keep her wanting, for he refers to her as a wild falcon that he must train to obey his call.", "He intends to prevent her

leaves.", "Hortensio has decided to marry a wealthy widow instead of Bianca and is leaving to go to Petruchio's to attend \"taming-school.", "He wants to see how Petruchio handles Kate so that he can

deflect the blame onto Grumio, but Petruchio and Grumio indignantly force him to leave.", "Petruchio, however, secretly tells Hortensio to pull the tailor aside and tell him that he will be paid the following day, revealing that Petruchio's distasteful treatment of the tailor is in jest.", "Petruchio then tells Kate that they will leave at once for Padua in the clothes that they have on, planning to arrive at noon.", "But, when Kate tells Petruchio that noontime has already passed, he angrily responds that, yet again, she is contradicting him.", "He declares that they will not go that day, and
